60,CMV: Tougher gun laws would not have prevented yesterday's tragedy where Bryce Williams killed Alison Parker and Adam Ward,FALSE,0,t3_3ilt4t,"Firstly, my heart goes out to the victims and by no means am I making excuses or defending any actions. Yesterday's events were a tragedy. Having grown up on Smith Mountain Lake and spent countless days on the very docks that the incident took place and having gone to the same school as Alison, the events hit really close to home. May Alison and Adam rest in peace.

Secondly, I am not coming from the pro or anti gun legislation perspective. If I could remove all guns from the world and safely fill the sport and personal self-defense gaps with something else with a single wish, I would... after I wished for $1 billion and 22 year old Heidi Klum to be my wife. I wanted to talk specifically about premeditated murder and the role firearms play in them. 

While watching the comments role through in yesterday's /r/news thread, several comments mentioned the desire for tougher gun laws. However, I believe that in instances of premeditated murder (vs manslaughter or random acts of violence), tougher gun laws would not prevent these events. 

I am going to repeat myself a few times, but bear with me: 

Despite all of the reason for Bryce Williams not to commit yesterday's crime, he still decided to go through with it. Despite the consequences that he would face legally, he decided to go through with it. Despite the pain he would cause to the families of the Alison and Adam as well as his own, he decided to go through with it. Despite the hate and vitriol his memory would leave, he decided to through with it. Despite all of the reasons not to go through with it, he decided to go through with it. 

My argument is, if guns were more difficult or impossible to get access to, Bryce Williams would have just added it to the list of hinderances he ignored and still gone through with it. Hypothetically not having access to a fire arm, I believe he would have still gone through the act of trying to kill Alison and Adam by another means. 

I so badly want to believe that we can prevent incidents like yesterday's from happening through tougher gun legislation or any other way, but I cannot see how. Please change my view. ",60,TRUE,1,FALSE,0
1030,"CMV: The term ""African American"" should be cast aside in favor of a more accurate classification, likely ""Black"" or something like it.",FALSE,0,t3_3aav96,"I believe that ""African-American"" is an invention of an overly-PC culture that doesn't actually address what it intends to address. Clearly this post deals most with the US, as I don't even know what other predominantly white countries use as an identifier. 

The vast majority of the time anybody uses the term ""African American"", it is intended to speak to the person's appearance, not their centuries-old heritage. When discussing issues like racism, your appearance is what matters and your appearance isn't ""African American"", it's a darker complexion. If you were at an African cultural festival or something, then the term might be appropriate, but otherwise it's not. 

""Black"" is  by far a more appropriate classification for conversations about race. Were you harassed by police because of your skin tone, or because your great-great-great-great-great-great grandparent was from Africa? There are obviously other physical characteristics (hair, facial construction, etc) that generally go along with the complexion, but the one that is most readily identifiable is skin tone. People also already associate ""Black"" with those attributes.

Further, many Black people don't identify as African American. Many of them immigrated directly from non-African countries or had parents who did the same. A Black person from England isn't classified as an African-European-American, despite that being more accurate. Additionally, many White people DO meet the requirements of being African-American, having been born there or had some family stop-over there, but obviously in a discussion about race, their experiences were not the same as a black person.",1030,TRUE,1,TRUE,1
264,CMV: The reason people are against sagging pants to the point of erecting laws against it has absolutely nothing to do with race.,FALSE,0,t3_3gm9al,"EDIT: So far people have been denouncing the reasons I give for it not being about race, but no one has given me a reason why it is about race. Just trying to shoot down my reason without presenting an argument is to why it is about race isn't going to change my mind. 

-------------------------------------------------

I have been against it for years. Frankly I find it unsightly as well as unhygienic. Recently among the race stuff showing up in the media people tried saying this was one. Just another race baiting tactic. I’m an open minded individual about lots things, but your argument has to be pretty damn good to CMV. If your ride public transportation or sit in any public area, during the summer especially, your bare ass is only separated from the seat by a thin piece of cloth. How could anyone with a shred of common sense find this okay? Its incredibly gross.

Just look at it from a spectators point of view. More than 95% of people are appalled by this “fashion trend” that has also been widely proven to come from prison. Why would you want to give off that type of air about you. Who wants to look at someone else’s underwear anyway? There is absolutely no other place where people show off their underwear in such a manner and get away with it. It is indecent exposure.

**There are a plenty of reasons that this trend gets so much hate and none of them have to do with race.** Tell me one fashion trend that's as bad as this that gets no attention. You can't. I mean hell, black people aren’t the only one’s that do it. I guarantee that if there was a “fashion trend” as atrocious as this started by any other group it would get the same backlash.

597,"CMV: Gay people are gay because of their upbringing and socialization, not because of biological factors.",TRUE,1,t3_3e7632,"I think gay people are gay because of their upbringing and socialization, not because of biological factors. I think it happens in families where the father doesn't fulfill the authoritarian male role, and/or the mother doesn't fulfill the nourishing female role.

I also think that gay people probably won't be fulfilling those two roles in future generations, thus increasing the chance of new gay people emerging from new families.

I'm not sure if that's good or bad. I think the average gay couple will have fewer children than straight couples, which is great considering there's like 7 billion of us already. Then again, I think gay children will have more trouble in their lives for a few more decades (even more in conservative societies).

My speculations are based on a bit of Freud, a bit of Wikipedia, and a bit of personal experience with gay people I know.

1266,CMV:One sex is superior to the other,FALSE,0,t3_37wyx6,"I'm not sure which sex is the superior one, although I'm sure if someone took the time to tally up all of the positive and negative attributes on each side it could be figured out. One sex must be superior to the other because the sexes have differences that lead to their lives being inarguably better than the other sex because of it. For example, women live longer on average than men which is clearly in favor of women, but men are stronger on average than women, which is clearly in favor of men. While these may cancel out, I find it highly unlikely that after going through every difference, men and women would somehow come to the exact same ""score"".

I don't want this to become a debate about the semantics of the words superior or better because some traits are clearly better than others. Also, this post only applies to humans.

Edit: For the sake of this debate, ""better"" and ""superior"" traits are ones that on average lead to a person having a (insert all positive adjectives here) life.

Edit 2: Again about saying what better is - Pretend if you could choose a sex at birth, we're trying to figure out which one you should choose to have the most fulfilled and happiest life.

996,"CMV: I believe the term ""cisgender"" doesn't need to be adopted by said ""cisgendered"" people. I liken it to diabetics creating a word for non-diabetics other than ""healthy"" or ""normal.""",FALSE,0,t3_3akupp,"I love transgendered people, and I find this new (to me) topic interesting.

But I don't think that normally gendered people need to use the term cisgender, or even know what it is. I also don't think it's wrong to refer to a cisgendered person as ""normal,"" (edit: regarding their gender identity and not them as a whole person) rather than cisgendered. 

If the trans community want to have terms like this, which I obviously see the utility of, then great, call me that all you want.

I just don't understand why suddenly I am not a normal male, and why it's offensive to refer to myself as a normal &lt;gender&gt;. I don't see why certain transsexual individuals have attacked me for simply refering to cisgender as normal, instead of this ""designated male at birth"" terminology I had never heard of before venturing over to /r/trans. 

I would compare this to anyone with an uncommon trait getting vocally offended by not being refered to by a specific terminology they feel more comfortable with. If autistic children, diabetics, people with parkinson's and paraplegics all wanted to be called something new, it would get incredibly confusing to talk to people without offending anyone.

I completely understand that transsexuals have a hard life, huge suicide rate, etc., but I don't think that babying them by tiptoeing around words like ""normal"" when they simply are not normally gendered humans is the right approach. I don't believe masking or avoiding reality is ever a good thing, and we can easily push for equal rights and respect for all transsexuals, even if people reserve the word normal when it comes to gender for someone who is cisgendered.

810,CMV: You cannot object to a mosque being built unless you're also prepared to protest the building of any other place of worship. Anything else is discrimination.,FALSE,0,t3_3c8kaw,"  This has become something of an issue in my home country of the UK where far-right groups have often targeted the building of mosques as a point of contention, even calling for bans. However I take issue with this. 

  Firstly, under the provisions of UK building law, anyone or any group is free to buy land, to submit planning permissions and to them build any building permitted by the provisions of the planning agreement on said land. Muslims are not and cannot be discriminated against in this regard. My local mosque was built by community donations, raising almost £2m almost entirely of their own doing, before quite legally submitting a planning application, getting the plans approved and then building the mosque (using local builders and trades actually). This would be no different in my eyes to the building of a synagogue, church, gurdwara or any other place of worship. 

  Secondly, the actual dedicated building of a completely dedicated mosque building is more an exception than a rule, especially in smaller Muslim communities. Certainly for my own town, there exists probably only one actual brand-new mosque (the one I mention above). Others are in previously existing buildings. 

 I am aware that there are issues to do with noise, people parking and blocking local streets/blocking resident access, but this is something which is typically taken into consideration at the planning permission stage. The way it works, there is usually a consultation period where civil planning experts consider issues such as these, and any person or group who feels the need to do so can raise an objection to the council for consideration. This goes for ANY building within a council's area, not just places of worship. 

   It must also be said that the noise and parking issues are also going to be an issue with any place of worship. I live in an area where the main church for that area is on a main residential road, and come any activity held at that church sees the main road itself, as well as a nearby tiny carpark, blocked with cars. I've also lived near a church which, come any major event, used to ring the bells and have large amounts of people there. The noise was very loud. 

  The only objection I can see seems to amount to a form of discrimination where simply because it is a mosque being built, people object. There seems to be no logical reason for their objections other than 'because Islam'. 

So, can anyone CMV?

1113,"CMV: There is no such thing as subreddit ban evasion. A subreddit is a topic of conversation, not a person.",FALSE,0,t3_39j94g,"All the hoopla about the FPH subreddit bans has resulted in quite a bit of conversation, but there seems to be little acknowledgement of the huge number of FPH *related* subreddits that have been, and continue to be banned despite not actually having broken any rules themselves. The admins seem to be acting as though these related subreddits are a form of ban evasion, and most people seem to agree. Meanwhile, the claim continues to be that they are only banning rule breakers, not censoring ideas.

What disturbs me about this is that **there is no such thing as subreddit ban evasion.**

A subreddit is not a person, it is a topic of conversation. If, after a particular subreddit is banned for breaking the rules, people go on to set up new subreddits with the same topic of conversation... shouldn't that subreddit have the same opportunity to follow the rules as any other? If those mods can do a better job, shouldn't they get the chance?

On the other hand, if simply setting up a new subreddit for the same topic is treated as ban evasion, and immediately banned as well, then isn't that exactly equivalent to *banning the topic?* If the admins are banning all subreddits for a particular topic of conversation, a particular idea, and for no other reason then being for that topic, being that idea... then isn't that objectively the banning of the idea?

I am very disturbed at the thought that all those folks crying censorship might actually be right this time, and even more so at the thought that the admins might actually be lying to us. I don't want this to be the case, but I cannot see a reasonable alternative explanation. :(

Please, change my view.

**EDIT:**

Just to be clear, I'm not necessarily saying they *shouldn't* have banned those subreddits (or that they *should* have either), I'm just saying that what they are doing is in fact entirely materially equivalent to banning the idea, which they claim not to be doing.

As for the question of evidence for the fact that they are in fact banning subreddits simply because of their topic, I'll use one unique example that proves it particularly well:

Consider the fact that [they accidentally banned /r/whalewatchers for a short time](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/39g65l/reddit_bans_rwhalewatching_thinking_its_a_clone/), a two year old subreddit that's *actually about whale watching*, simply because trolls posted some FPH related content (which the mods would have obviously removed anyway).

If they were only banning rule breakers, how could /r/whalewatchers, a two year old subreddit that couldn't possibly have had evidence of rule breaking associated with it, have earned a banning *even if they did mistakenly think it was dedicated to hating fat people?*

I can find no reasonable explanation as to how that mistake could *even have been possible* if they were only banning rule breakers and not banning ideas.

1004,"CMV: Dog fighting should be legalized, taxed, and regulated at animal shelters.",TRUE,1,t3_3ajn0a,"In much the same way as drugs, prostitution, gambling, or other ""victimless"" crimes, dog fighting is going to happen irrespective of the law.  Legalization would lead to increased tax revenue, less organized crime. and safer, more humane environments for all those involved.  It would also end the practice of baiting game dogs with helpless puppies and the like.

I understand that many would argue that the dogs are victims (as are drug addicts and prostitutes for that matter), but only in the sense that eating horse meat (which is illegal in many places) victimizes horses, or even horse racing, which is already legalized, taxed, and regulated in controlled environments.

The fact is countless dogs are already being put to death in animal shelters, often at the taxpayers' expense.  Revenue from dog fighting could alleviate this cost considerably, perhaps even allowing animals to be kept longer, increasing their chances of adoption.  Highly aggressive dogs are unlikely to ever be adopted however (except perhaps by illegal dog-fighting fans currently), nor should they be.  

It would only be the aggressive dogs used in fights, as they're clearly willing. That's why they need to be kept in separate cages, otherwise they'd be mauling each other of their own volition.  Dogs too old, young, sickly, or cowardly to fight could still be put down as usual since they would make for unentertaining match-ups and would be bad for gambling.

Even the dogs that do fight would receive better medical treatment afterwards from veterinarians on hand, and/or humane euthanasia rather than drowning, hanging, etc.  You certainly wouldn't get the likes of a Michael Vick doing a Pete Townshend impression with a terrier in place of a guitar.

607,CMV: I don't think the Chattanooga shootings were terrorist attacks,FALSE,0,t3_3e2rf6,"[On July 16, 2015, a gunman opened fire on two military installations in Chattanooga, Tennessee, killing four service members immediately. Two other service members and a police officer were wounded, with one of the servicemen dying from his injuries two days later. The gunman, Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez, was killed by police at the site of the second shooting.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Chattanooga_shootings)

I feel terrible for the families of the victims of these attacks, but to me, this was an attack on soldiers at a military target.  The US military today is able to conduct war through drone strikes from across the planet.  The attacks weren't on traditional war targets, but the US blows up enemy training grounds and recruiting sites all the time.  We don't consider those attacks terrorist attacks, we consider them strikes on legitimate military targets that weaken our enemy.  I think it's naive and arrogant to arrogant to think an American drone strike on a Taliban recruiting ground is a legitimate act of war and that an attack on an American recruiting ground is a terrorist attack.  

I'm not trying to justify his actions or his beliefs, I'm more sayitg that **Terrorist Attacks** in my opinion are unjustifiable strikes against non-combatants, they are war crimes, they are despicable and criminal, but that the Chattanooga attacks were something different.  The perpetrator is still our enemy, but we shouldn't demonize him as a terrorist.

1488,CMV: Nuclear war in the near future is inevitable until virtually all such weapons are eliminated.,FALSE,0,t3_35rkzr,"By near future, I mean 0 to 100 years. Given the irrationality of humanity, and the long history of systemic failures leading to the unthinkable, the presence of nuclear weapons represents an existential risk that is all too plausible.

The total yield of all nuclear weapons is measured in the *gigatons*. Though work has been done in the area of disarmament, the pace is far too slow to be meaningful. Even the presence of 20 modern nuclear weapons is an intolerable threat. 

But a nuclear war involving only 20 weapons is a pipe dream. There are thousands of 'active' nuclear weapons, ready to be deployed, and at the current pace of disarmament, any nuclear war within the next 100 years will involve *at least* hundreds of weapons, with a total explosive yield in the hundreds of megatons.

Even one is too many. If, for example, terrorists detonated a nuclear weapon of moderate yield in Manhattan, simulations have shown a total fatality amount of nearly a million. Economic damage due to both direct and indirect effects would likely be in the trillions. Geopolitics would be utterly and irreversibly destabilized for the foreseeable future. North Korea and Iran would suddenly appear to require immediate military intervention to forestall future attacks, and the American public would gladly endorse it.

This even would represent one of the greatest calamities in human history. Yet the threat of this pales when compared with a nuclear war involving multiple nations. In a full-scale nuclear war, immediate causalities would be in the hundreds of millions, potentially rising to billions depending on the extent of the war and the resulting collapse of infrastructure and climate stability. The very concept of a global economy would cease to exist. Humanity would be plunged into internecine conflict for decades, possibly centuries, as those still alive fought tooth and claw over the rubble of civilization. Suffice to say, short of an asteroid impact on the scale of Chicxulub, it is hard to imagine a worse fate for mankind.

Now, let me address the problem of mutually assured destruction. This subject really requires its own topic, but I'll try to be as concise as I can. All major nuclear arsenals are organized around this idea, and so they are kept ready at all times, waiting for the call. This is insanely dangerous, as it means any mistake or false positive will not simply cause some weapons to be launched in retaliation, but *all* weapons. Implicit in the idea of MAD is that any nuclear strike must be responded to with overwhelming force, and the response must happen **immediately**, long before the bombs start going off.  A submarine-launched ballistic missile would take less than 15 minutes to reach a major city - that is the window our leaders have to judge if an attack is real or imaginary. Mistakes and false positives of this kind [have already happened](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislav_Petrov), and will surely happen in the future. We only need be unlucky once. 

If that weren't bad enough, we have the growing danger of missile defense initiatives, which although perhaps well-intentioned, serve to destabilize the already questionable state of nuclear deterrence. What happens when, for one country, MAD is no longer mutual? If you believe your only true means of defense is being taken from you, what response do you have left?

But here is what is really scary, what should truly frighten you: it doesn't frighten you at all. This is the great paradox of nuclear war. It is simply too big to fathom. Just like attempting to imagine the scale of the universe, our minds fail us. Because we cannot imagine it, we dismiss it as a kind of fantasy. I am guilty of this too. Here I am, writing this post with all sincerity, and yet to contemplate it doesn't disturb me one bit. Of course it won't happen, right?

I feel that this is the true peril we are facing. While our leaders may understand the threat intellectually, they have no visceral reaction to it. Not the reaction required to affect the needed changes to remove the threat. As history teaches us, world leaders are perpetually blindsided by what seems so obvious in hindsight.

We saw this with WWI: who would have thought one assassination would lead to a war killing millions? We saw this with 9/11: who would have thought it was so trivial to use commercial jets as weapons? We saw this with credit default swaps: who would have thought how easily they would cause systemic collapse of the economy? Who would have thought...

This where we are right now. The weapons are here, they are ready. The trigger need only the lightest pressure. And you aren't worried, you aren't worried at all.

1197,"CMV:I no longer believe in supporting digital media publishers because even when I do the right thing, I get fucked.",FALSE,0,t3_38lt1n,"I bought a lot of games, and I do mean a lot. I bought them  even though other people are using bootleg copies because it was the right thing to do and because I didn't want to risk getting in trouble. However, the people who get the bootleg copy do not need to put a disk in the drive to play the game, because the bootleg copies come pre-cracked. This is important today, where a lot of modern computers do not ship with optical drives. 

Toting around a bunch of DVDs to play in a laptop because I was stupid enough to actually buy the game feels like the developers and publishers are just knifing me in the nuts for supporting them. My other option is to use cracks, which is legally questionable and comes with the risk of malware. I'm not even talking about new games, either. Many of them are PC games from the PS2 generation. If they insist on shoving malware on me for buying the games, why can't they at least take it out when the product is past its prime so I can enjoy what I paid for on fair terms without opening myself to risks? If they expect IP rights to last so long, why are they not forced to support a product for that same length of time?

The solution is to never support any of these publishers again, because clearly the objective is to fuck me over and run.

Then, what about mothers who leave the child at the fire station/put the child up for adoption? 

Putting up for adoption does not guarantee the child will be adopted. Thus, the parent still owes the child child support until s/he is actually adopted.

1297,"CMV: ""All struggles are class struggles"" (at least in the modern capitalist world we live in)",FALSE,0,t3_37jkaw,"In the capitalist world we live in, we are faced with inequality all around us, and more and more as I've talked with and debated friends I seem to be the only one who thinks that all struggles are class struggles. Wealth generally can translate into power, and a powerfully elite class has become more prevalent in America and the world, with the 1% controlling stupidly large sums of money and a growing distension in the lower class and upper class.

 I'm not saying racism doesn't exist, because I'm confident is does, but I'm saying the route of racism and sexism, two issues that have been frequently addressed recently with feminist and civil rights movements, are because through the last several hundred years, classes that promoted inequality for women and black Americans were based off of a wealth and power dynamic that was systematically designed to keep an elite. My friends often are criticizing me, saying that I'm just afraid to talk about issues on race and gender, although I find myself to be very liberal.

 I think people are just afraid to admit this idea of social inequality in a capitalist world is far too out of their control because of the power dynamic that the elite have set for hundreds of years, and that they think they can really change something by focusing too much on the gender or color of a persons skin to explain their problems, and not the socioeconomic situation they are stuck in. Some inner cities are essentially ghettos and class mobility and the ""American Dream"" are now more or less impossible to achieve in my opinion.

I should note I have divorced parents, one who struggle on a single income and one who was very successful financially so I've had the ""tale of two cities"" on the subject. I've also attending a private boarding school, and I've noticed incredible elitism and entitlement from my peers that are often in the top 5% of American wealth, and this sense of entitlement seems to not judge on race, gender, or sexual orientation. 

So Reddit, CMV: are all struggles really class struggles?

208,"CMV: Raising your voice during arguments is fine (when there aren't, e.g. children around).",TRUE,1,t3_3h6p8v,"I just had my dad tell me to lower my voice during an argument, but often I'm not even aware I'm raising it.

I, personally, don't think raising your voice during an argument is a bad thing - when you're angry, you often can't talk calmly and it's fucking stupid to call someone out on something that's completely normal to do when they're upset, particularly in the way that my dad called me out, namely, ""Am I raising my voice? I'm talking to you in a normal voice"". I think it's a normal reaction, and it shouldn't be seen as something we need to tone down (unless we are in, say, a public place). When you're angry, you're by definition unable to be calm, and yet people treat it as some sort of heinous fault.

Edit: Regarding the bit about the children, I meant more in the sense of scaring/traumatising the child with constant, loud arguments, e.g. wrt parents who can't stay under the same roof without shouting at each other.

102,CMV: The Koran wants us all dead.,FALSE,0,t3_3i6jma,"Unless we convert, of course.

Let me just say that Islam has been through many reforms and most muslims don't wish for the death of anyone.  There is a great deal of integration between Islam and modern society, but this isn't about the moderate majority. Also, terrorism and warfare in the Middle East are heavily fueled by politics.

If we accept that the Koran is the primary source of all that is Islam, and we accept that some (hundreds of millions?) individuals believe that the Koran is the unqestionable word of God, and we accept that the Koran clearly calls for the murder of nonbelievers (In the form of over 100 verses and the violent actions of Muhammad himself), then it follows that we've got a serious problem on our hands that will persist for as long as Islam remains. 

So, what am I missing here? Why are we all tolerating it? Nothing we can do about it? Afraid we'll be murdered for speaking out? Even the most brutally honest public figures, like comedians, will never mention Islam. Penn Jillette has some serious balls just to say this much during an interview about his show ""Bullshit"".

""Are there any groups you won't go after?""

""We haven't tackled Scientology because Showtime doesn't want us to. Maybe they have deals with individual Scientologists –- I'm not sure. And we haven't tackled Islam because we have families.""



Bonus CMV's:

The crusades were clearly justified. They were a defensive war, and a response to muslim aggression into Europe and the Middle East.

If Muhammad was alive today, he would be a supporter of ISIS, or maybe lead it himself.

852,CMV: Personal use vehicles (except with handicapped plates) should be banned from city centers,FALSE,0,t3_3bwnmo,"Let's face it. Nobody likes driving in the city. Some people have chosen to arrange their lives in such a way that it's necessary, but overall, it's a miserable experience for everyone involved. By forcing this change, everyone's life would ultimately be improved. I should clarify I mean personal use *motorized* vehicles. Bicycles are fine. Commercial vehicles such as buses, taxis, and delivery trucks obviously need to get into and out of the city.

1. The budget for road repairs would be greatly reduced, as would the need for traffic police, and meter readers.
2. The money saved from the above could be used to expand and improve public transit.
3. Parking could be moved from expensive downtown real estate to the cheaper fringes of the city (where drivers could park and take public transit downtown).
4. Pollution would be greatly reduced.
5. Traffic would be greatly reduced. Instead of becoming increasingly concentrated as everyone approaches downtown, it would remain dispersed in the suburbs since there would be more spread out points around the city where people pick up public transit.
6. The city would be much safer for bicycles and pedestrians.
7. The real estate freed up from parking could be given over to other uses, lowering rents in desirable areas for everyone.
8. Emergency services would have a much faster response time due to less traffic in the city.

I'm sure there's even more benefits. I can't think of any downsides except that it would annoy some people who currently drive because they would have to change.

1476,CMV: Believing that free trade is bad despite near universal consensus among economists that it's beneficial is no different than believing that climate change isn't real despite near universal consensus among client scientists that it is.,FALSE,0,t3_35tsu6,"Free trade yields positive results for every country involved, and this is an established economic fact. Consumers in richer countries get to purchase goods at lower prices (which raises their standard of living) while poorer countries get capital investments and higher incomes (which raises their standard of living). Personally, I like that I can wake up, sip my Costa Rican coffee as I sit on my Swedish furniture and watch my Japanese TV before checking my Korean phone and getting in my German car to go to work for an American company that gets 90% of its revenue from overseas. If those goods all had to be made in America, they would probably be of lower quality because global competition is unequivocally good for consumers.

Despite this, ""free trade"" is still a controversial political topic. Reddit's two most popular politicians, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, have both promised to help stop jobs from being shipped overseas and have both been very critical of NAFTA, claiming that it has hurt America and has cost it hundreds of thousands of jobs. However, actual [peer-reviewed analysis](http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/trade/effects-of-nafta-on-us-employment-and-policy-responses_5k9ffbqlvk0r-en?crawler=true) that studied NAFTA after it was implemented suggested it had a negligible impact on American jobs (and a paper by Matusz suggested it had a very small but positive impact).

If a person doesn't believe in evolution or climate change despite overwhelming empirical evidence and expert consensus to the contrary, then they are being anti-science. And I believe that if you think free trade is a net negative despite overwhelming empirical evidence and expert consensus to the contrary, then you're being anti-science. 

So, CMV and explain why free trade is a bad thing.

462,CMV: NCAA Athletes should be paid,FALSE,0,t3_3f3a59,"The NCAA made close to a billion dollars in revenue in 2013 and their athletes were awarded with none of it. Yes I understand they get scholarships and are worth thousands of dollars but when players such as Shabazz Napier report to go to bed without eating because of lack of money that becomes a problem. Most athletes put in 40 hours of practice into their sport a week so the argument of getting a job is invalid considering they have classes to worry about on top of their sport. Division 1 college football coaches see a salary of 1.63 million dollars ( on average) and their salary continues to grow while the actual athletes don't see a dime. These athletes should be appropriately awarded with money made from merchandise sales that use their names. I am not saying that these athletes should be given thousands of dollars but be appropriately compensated for their work.

Of course, if you require photo ID to vote, then you must take steps to make sure it is easy for all citizens to obtain acceptable ID.  This may be difficult for citizens without birth certificates or social security cards, but I feel like there must be some way to more accurately keep track of citizens.

403,CMV: The national minimum wage should be $10.10 per hour immediately.,FALSE,0,t3_3fktzq,"Three pillar of my changeable view:
* America desperately needs an immediate minimum wage increase right now today. 
* It should be $10.10/hour nationally. States and cities can raise it from there based on their own regional costs of living. 
* Nationally, it should be raised periodically, tied to inflation. 
* There is a such thing as too high. $15/hour is too high. 

**TLDRs in bold!**

Obviously, I'm not even going to entertain arguments that say minimum wage is too high (at $7.25) or shouldn't exist. I'm just going to skip that. 

**Earning less than $10/an hour is akin to slave labor - even without considering cost of living.** In 2012 I worked a very very labor intensive job for $9.50/hour. I was a been merchandiser. I was responsible for lifting heavy cases of beer all day long. It really felt like salve labor. I made about $1300 over the summer while I finished the final requirements of my college degree. I was living on campus and student loans/parents were paying for my food and housing. So the money I made was just savings and pocket money. Forget about cost of living, it still felt like I was a slave. **That's why the increase to $10.10 should be immediate** - not a gradual increase of the next four years. 

It should increase periodically commensurate with inflation, not once a decade, but every other year. So that we're not having this same conversation again in a decade: people working 60 hours and still homeless. 

I don't know what mathematical formula the Obama administration used to come up with $10.10/hour, but that amount seems fair to me. It's not so much that you can get comfortable flipping burgers but it's enough that you can earn money without being enslaved.  **I really feel like $15 is too high.**  You're not supposed to be comfortable flipping burgers. People who support that are just ignoring drawbacks to a high minimum wage. 


Try to change my view either way - to $15/hour or if you're republican try to convince me in the opposite direction.

1243,CMV: Police body cameras are a good option to deal with police accountabllity.,FALSE,0,t3_382wa7,"Body cameras for police are beneficial because they increase accountability for both police and civilians. Tony Farrar, the police chief of Rialto, California says “""When you know you're being watched you behave a little better. That's just human nature. As an officer you act a bit more professional, follow the rules a bit better."" This increase in accountability would greatly improve police/civilian interaction. 


Body cameras also reduce police officers use of force. After cameras were introduced in Rialto California in February of 2012, Officers' use of force fell by 60%.  This comes in turn with the increase in officer accountability, and the improvement of the relationship between officer and civilian. 

While some people may say that police body cameras will infringe on the privacy rights of individuals interacting with the police, the benefits of body cameras far outweigh any possible disadvantage. Additionally it is possible to edit the footage from body cameras in order to protect the privacy of those not involved in a specific incident.

 If body cameras had been implemented nationwide years ago, cases like the controversial shooting of Michael Brown may very well never have happened,  and if they had, body cameras would have provided excellent evidence for the cases, making it far easier to determine exactly what had happened. Overall, the benefits of implementing body cameras on police officers far outweigh the disadvantages.

620,CMV: Isn't 'brigading' kind of... what Reddit does/is for?,FALSE,0,t3_3dynmw,"when i first started using Reddit, it amazed me that it had the power to draw the public's attention to anything you could find on the internet. in an age where mainstream news is biased and groomed, things like the TPP, police brutality, corruption, and even small specific situations like the élan school were brought to the attention of Millions because people upvoted it on reddit.

When SOPA was on your front page, with senator's phone numbers in the top comment, they were most certainly 'brigaded'. because the necessary people were slammed with thousands of voicemails and millions of emails, a real difference was made. what about all the times we link to petitions, or laws that are being voted on? ever notice what happens to the comment section of a youtube video or news item that makes front page? this is all brigading, but it is not a bad thing.

it's a bad thing when a group of people specifically team up to harass. but we shouldn't lump harassment in with voting... under this one term, 'brigading'

i really enjoy browsing the debates on r/subredditdrama because they (usually) link to an argument without encouraging you to take a specific side or have a certain opinion about it. sometimes i'll read 30-50 responses in a thread and forget that i was linked to it from SRD and it really annoys me that if i cast a vote somewhere in there, i risk a ban.

i guess the whole point is, it's silly that we can't cast a vote on a debate we are linked to within Reddit. especially when 'brigading' (bringing people's attention to something) is how Reddit has helped make the world a better place, in small but significant ways.

631,CMV: SJWs are as bad as the sexists/racists they purport to oppose,FALSE,0,t3_3dsjqa,"I am angry beyond exasperation by the generalised hate some of the SJWs I appear to follow/friend are sharing/re-sharing on Twitter/Facebook recently.

I can't stand by it any longer -- if you share something that generalises men / women / white people / asian people / immigrants / wealthy people / poor people / Northern / Southern / City / Rural... In fact, pretty much anything you attack by generalising a group based on one bad example -- I feel the need to not only unfollow you, I think I need to make sure you understand why I'm doing it. Publicly.

That goes equally for people that make unfair assertions about people it's ""cool"" to hate: Such as calling UKIP (UK Independence Party who exist to try and remove the UK from the EU) racists, or Conservatives (once again, a UK political party, currently in Government office) thieves, or the police thugs. I've never met a racist UKIP member, a Conservative thief, or a police thug.

Prejudice happens. We all have prejudices. I have prejudices. Allowing that prejudice to become discrimination, and that discrimination becoming openly attacking people is something we all need to combat. If one of your friends starting mouthing obscenities towards a gay man, or a black woman, I'd hope you'd try to stop them. You should do the same for someone attacking a straight man too because he's male and straight and not because he's done something himself.

Somehow it has become acceptable to post insulting things like https://twitter.com/flexlibris/status/621873976063692800 which tar all men (in this particular example) with the same brush. People I respect retweet it. That's just not fair, and it's something I can't put up with any longer.

If you want to point out *a* man acting inappropriately, that's fine by me. I've done it before, and while I know a lot of people just turn away and pretend it's not happening, I'd like to believe that many would say something.

If you say *all* men are trash, you're attacking *me* and *I've* done nothing wrong.

This kind of generalisation behaviour is completely unacceptable to me, and these people are just as bad -- no, they're WORSE than the people they're trying to oppose. They DO know better and choose to be inflammatory.

Generalising a group of people based on bad information is exactly why many major conflicts occur worldwide. I'm not talking about in history and making a veiled Nazi reference, I'm talking about today. People *today* are excluded because of sweeping generalisations like the ones these people perpetuate.

I can't stand silently by it any longer. If I don't speak out against it, it gives silent consent to those that do it. However, I realise that perhaps I'm over-reacting and there's another side to this story.

So, before I go on a massive unfollow and outrage spree amongst people posting SJW type material: (Try and...) Change My View!

1444,"CMV: Coffee is overrated, the effects received are negligible and often a placebo, and people who say they like the taste are lying to themselves.",TRUE,1,t3_362xxo,"I understand the philosophy behind acquiring tastes (learned to love San Pellegrino), but I cannot for the life of me truly find myself appreciating coffee like many of my friends do.

Every child growing up seems to desire coffee, but only because it's age restricted, similar to alcohol/tobacco. Now I don't have a PhD in psychology or anything, but there is evidence beyond proof that people want what they can't have. It's just human nature, and I feel like it's what's behind the longterm desire for coffee in that something I was once barred from is now freely enjoyed and encouraged. It doesn't help that many people jack their cups with sugars and creams which at a certain point require speculation as to which substance is actually fueling your perceived energy boost.

I consider myself to be very openminded, especially when it comes to substances put into the body for recreational purposes (I'll leave it at that) but I can't seem to see eye-to-eye to my friends that have been religiously trying to convert me all these years.

The extent of my coffee experience would be instant coffee growing up at home (parents weren't 'connoisseurs' by any iteration of the term but were both pretty addicted to), pretentious (shots fired) coffee shops that my fiends would literally drag me to, and the occasional tinder date Starbucks run in which I would just end up getting the vanilla bean frappe 90% of the time, which is delicious by the way.

It seems to me like the most elite coffee drinkers in my socials circles tend to hate Starbucks. Maybe because they think it's cool to do so and are attempting to show everyone how much they know about how coffee should taste like.

Could that be the reason? Have I just had bad coffee? Has my past experienced not done justice to an entire culture that is coffee? I mean people spend hundreds of dollars a year on it, and for what?

However I use it as my day to day operating system and I don't really see what's wrong with it. The main complaint seems to be the start screen replacing the start menu. And while the start screen UI could be better, I prefer it to the start menu and if you really hate it you can install something like classic shell to bring back to the start menu.  
To change my view here you should tell me if there's something worse than the start screen in Windows 8 that makes it that bad. Or if the start screen really is that bad.

1328,CMV: absolute majority in elections should not mean getting voted by way less than 50% of the total population,FALSE,0,t3_376jla,"I can't get why does this even make sense. For me it's easy. Usually elections arround the world go from 50% to 75-80% of participation.

Let's say 75% for example. Out of that, a party gets 33% of the votes. Or even a 50% it doesn't really matter. And they get absolute majority (this OBVIOUSLY changes with countrys and stuff but many share a similar way of counting votes, as far as I know, which it's completly possible is not enough to understand this. But usually in Europe it's my understanding it works similar to this).

So 50% of 75% of participation (where I live it's usually WAY lower, for both %, but whatever), you get 0.375, 37.5% unless I'm mistaken. And with that alone, you can govern for 4,5, 6 years. 

Very few countrys have referendum to vote for stuff that happens between that 4 years so I do not get why this is a valid way of treating more than half of the population of a given place, that get completly ignored. Whether you voted or you did not, if you aren't part of that majority, you are ignored. Not even if you sum every other vote against that, you could get anything done (this one is more tricky and I guess it depends more on the region, but still, it should be easy to overun less than 50% of the total votes, let alone, less than 50% of the total population.

So cmv or tell me how it works in other places or why this makes sense or why does it seem so complex to improve this system.

581,CMV: Life is shit,FALSE,0,t3_3e96ml,"o* 
Life is shit. We're all going to die. Most of us are forced to work a 9-5 job we don't enjoy in order to put bread on the table. Over 40% of people in the UK will suffer cancer at some point. 900 million starving people in the world (but thanks to huge inequality and pure dumb luck you're not one of them). Studies have found that most of us would rate ourselves as ""happy"" or ""very happy"", but we're engineered to be overly-optimistic about our lives because an optimistic organism has better inclusive fitness; it is more inclined to ""try, try and try again"" until it breeds. Studies have found people tend to over-estimate the quality of their lives. Most people - even those living in poverty - must lie to themselves and others that their lives are worth living because the alternative would be to either face the cognitive dissonance that arises from continuing a life they believe is not worth continuing, or to kill themselves.
Our lives are devoid of meaning. Most people recognise that life objectively has no meaning, but go down the existentialist route of inventing some subjective bullshit reason to delude themselves that their lives are significant in some way. Some particularly introspective people will eventually come up against the Absurd - recognising the paradox of their being as an individual that desires meaning but finding themselves in a world devoid of any. Zapffe states we try to avoid dealing with this by ""artificially limiting the contents of our consciousness"" using the psychological defensive techniques of distraction, anchoring, isolation and sublimation. Our brains are constantly trying to bullshit ourselves, and for many people it works most of the time, but at times it fails.
""What about the happiness in life?"" What about it? According to Schopenhauer, what we call ""happiness"" is a ""negative"" (i.e. derivative) quantity, a label we attribute to the relative absence of suffering, which is the ""positive"" (i.e. real) element of existence. This is why the pleasures you experience are always less pleasurable than you expect, and the pains always considerably more painful.
Besides, even if you somehow find a true source of happiness, it wouldn't last. If there's one certainty in life beside death, it's the impermanence of all things. This is a truth recognised not only by Schopenhauer but in Buddhism as one of its core principles. It has a special name for the kind of suffering associated with our recognition of this impermanence of the state of affairs: Viparinama-dukkha. You enjoy your life now? In the best case, you're going to grow old and decrepid, and then die. Your significant other is going to die. Your pet cats and dogs are going to die. You'll get sick. You'll get hit by a car. You'll end unemployed. The economy will turn. So the takeaway is that happiness in a world like ours is fleeting at best, non-existent at worst. ""In a world where all is unstable, and nought can endure, but is swept onwards at once in the hurrying whirlpool of change; where a man, if he is to keep erect at all, must always be advancing and moving, like an acrobat on a rope — in such a world, happiness in inconceivable. How can it dwell where, as Plato says, continual Becoming and never Being is the sole form of existence? In the first place, a man never is happy, but spends his whole life in striving after something which he thinks will make him so; he seldom attains his goal, and when he does, it is only to be disappointed; he is mostly shipwrecked in the end, and comes into harbor with masts and rigging gone. And then, it is all one whether he has been happy or miserable; for his life was never anything more than a present moment always vanishing; and now it is over.""
And then we have Professor David Benatar, who explains in Better Never to Have Been that ""a life filled with good and containing only the most minute quantity of bad—a life of utter bliss adulterated only by the pain of a single pin-prick—is worse than no life at all"". He demonstrates that, due to an asymmetry that exists between the values of suffering and happiness when comparing situations that entail a transition from a state of non-existence to existence, every single one of us was overall harmed by being born.
Why do we exist? We're biological machines put together by our constituent genes to serve their interests by acting as vessels through which they can proliferate while having a measure of protection from their environment and the machines of competitor genes. We're engineered, like all life, to survive and breed effectively within our environments. It in the interest of these genes to wire our brains to believe our lives are meaningful and worth continuing however bullshit this might be because pessimists and nihilists tend to be far less inclined to survive and reproduce.
""Wretched, ephemeral race, children of chance and tribulation, why do you force me to tell you the very thing which it would be most profitable for you not to hear? The very best thing is utterly beyond your reach: not to have been born, not to be, to be nothing. However, the second best thing for you is: to die soon."" -- Aristotle, The Wisdom of Silenus",581,TRUE,1,FALSE,0
1343,CMV: Leasing a car is always and forever a bad choice.,TRUE,1,t3_371vcx," Would you go to Enterprise and rent a car for 24 months?  That's very similar to what a lease is.

1. **Suze Orman, very rich lady and personal finance guru, hates car leases in all situations.**  [If anyone ever brings up the topic of leasing a car, she just gives them a Suze Smackdown.](http://www.suzeorman.com/resource-center/suze-orman-money-tips-video-collection/lease-or-buy-a-car/) 

2. **People lease cars so they can afford to drive something they cannot buy.** ""You're spending money you don't have to impress people you don't know,"" Suze says. You should go to a used car lot and find something you can own for the same payment as what you would lease. It might not be that hard, the first owner took a 20-30% hit in value as soon as he took ownership. You might find the car 2 or 3 years old and you can buy with the same money. 

3. **When you look at the details, it just doesn't add up to a good deal.** You have to come up with a large down payment, pay monthly, and at the end of it all, you own nothing. To re up your lease, they expect another large down payment *for a car you already have*. Their are milage restrictions. 
Once I knew a guy who lived in Detroit and wanted to go to Chicago for the weekend, but was afraid to drive his car because he calculated that his daily commute was going to put him very close to or slightly beyond the mileage limit by lease end. 
You're paying monthly for a car that you can't drive whenever you want because they're going to charge you $.25 per mile over the limit. If you go 3000 miles over (which could happen in one road trip) that's $750 you have to pay *just to give the car back*.  Oh and you're also paying through the nose for any dent, ding, bump, stain or scratch in the car. 



Unless it's a company providing a company car for business purposes. Your employer isn't in the business of owning, servicing and managing vehicles for the long term so a lease makes sense for them. They dont have time to sell a car when they're done with it, or deal with ownership. All the drawbacks of leasing such as mileage fees, they probably just pass that on to employee driving it.

101,CMV: Age of consent laws are based on faulty anecdotes,FALSE,0,t3_3i6pc0,"Age of consent laws around the world vary dramatically, and even within the US there is a wide range of things that are acceptable or unacceptable depending on what state you are in. Most people are in support of age of consent laws, and will very aggressively assert that they want to protect the children. Many people will tell you that a sexual relationship between an adult and a child who is X years old is unquestionably damaging to the child, where X is usually a completely arbitrary number.

There is no doubt to me that an adult is capable of abusing a child in a relationship, and that the adult is capable of abusing the child in a way that the child believes they are consenting and does not believe they are being abused. I also believe that adults are capable of doing this to eachother in relationships where both people are of the consenting age.

Where things start to get shaky is the point when people start asserting that all sexual relationships are abusive once the 'victim' is below a certain age. I do not believe that there is sufficient scientific evidence to back up this claim. I do not believe that healthy sexual relationships occurring between adults and teens or children are given the proper room to breathe or prosper: as soon as a child is discovered to be in a sexual relationship with an adult, that child will be told repeatedly that their sexual partner is a bad person and that their sexual partner has abused them. I believe that this alone is sufficient to damage the child, regardless of whether the sexual relationship itself was damaging. Children are highly vulnerable to suggestion.

I believe that more rigorous scientific investigation is necessary to justify the age of consent laws, and that once the scientific evidence comes out, the age of consent laws should be adjusted accordingly. I know that, as a teenage boy, especially by 14 (but even, to a smaller degree, as early as 8 or 9) I would have been excited to engage in a sexual relationship with an attractive female. I don't see how this would have resulted in abuse or psychological damage (assuming, of course, that my partner had my best interests in mind). But that's just the problem, it's nothing more than an anecdote. People who oppose my views also provide anecdotes.

The amount of scientific research in this area is lacking, and lots of the mania surrounding child abuse laws come from unproven ideas about child innocence and susceptibility to abuse. As an even bolder step, I believe most age of consent laws are largely baseless as far as genuine evidence is concerned. (as a side note, these beliefs also extend to other child abuse laws, and also extend to student-teacher relationship laws).

Please, CMV

950,"CMV: The Shining(movie) does a poor representation of the hotels true power, as opposed to the books intent. Spoiler",FALSE,0,t3_3b0b2h,"First I will say I love both and like alternate versions of the same story. On the other hand I donnot understand the argument that the hotel is represented just as evil as it is in the book(not to be confused with the hotel is not evil in the movie).



Kubrick makes intended changes to the books plot seemingly to down play the true evil of the hotel. Take for instance the different endings. In the book the hotel is destroyed, and the movie it's left standing. If the hotel is as evil in the book as it is in the movie, the hotel should have been destroyed.


Take the maze scene. Kubrick places this maze scene in where Danny is chased by the insane gone over the edge jack. Where as the book jack is possessed by the hotel and chases Danny through the halls, his voice and demeanor is extremely unfamiliar to Danny. Jack seemingly goes over the edge as opposed to being possessed by a the hotel. 



Last example is the hedges. The hotel can control the hedges and bring them to life. As Danny's shine gets stronger and fuels the hotels power the hedges go from just moving their positions, to being able to attack the occupants. This is left out seemingly to downplay the hotels capabilities. That's as good place to start as any so Change my views.

Recently though, Romania has started to spend the budget more wisely (thanks to our Justice which has been sending to jail lots of corrupt politicians), by my reflex seems to have survived: I simply cannot cope with the idea of paying the Government.

1370,CMV: Music artists/bands should not release singles from their upcoming albums.,FALSE,0,t3_36ogj7,"Whenever I get really excited for a band's new album, I always listen to the singles to death and by the time the album comes out, I'm sick of those songs I can't experience the album as one  complete piece of work. And I know this is true of lots of people, not just myself. As much as I would like to simply not listen to singles, it's just too tempting when I've been craving new music from a band for two years.

I think artists should instead release a couple of teasers, that way people can get a taste for the sound of the new material, but without being completely exposed to a full song and potentially ruining the experience.

I also hate the current trend of streaming new albums a week before release dates. It really kills the anticipation, and it sucks when I pre-order music and everyone who didn't gets to listen to it early. If you crack and just listen to the stream, then you won't be as excited to listen to your copy for the first time when you finally get it. 

Obviously I don't expect record labels to try to enforce either of these ideas - *ever* - but I wish it would become the new trend. For the sake of experiencing music properly.

625,CMV Gender Identity and Gender Roles are the same thing... And they are both social constructs.,FALSE,0,t3_3dve0v,"Hello. I would like to make the argument that Gender Identity and Gender Roles are one in the same and socially constructed. Many people argue that there are three ways to look at gender.

1. Sex- This is based on physical attributes and is usually binary. This is simply the physical attributes of male, female, and intergender. These are obviously not social constructs.

2. Gender Identity- This is often seen what gender people ""feel"" that they are. For example, a physical male may identify as a female, and therefore their Gender Identity is female.

3. Gender Role- These are simply the societal expectations for each gender to act (i.e. Men don't wear high heels, women are more sensitive and emotional, blah blah blah)

I argue that Gender Identity CAN NOT exist without Gender Roles, and identity is simply based off of perceived Gender Roles... therefore, they are also social constructs. What it means to be a women is not something that we are born with. We are taught what it means to be a man and we are taught what it means to be a women. If someone was never exposed to the social constructs, these identities would not have a foundation to stand on... a socially constructed foundation.

I've been to a lot of hackathons (programming-marathons) and open-data is an awesome opportunity to make something cool and resume-building quickly (hackathons are usually only 24-48 hours overnight). The more data out there, the more possibilities there are to help the public or invent something novel.  

I think of the government the same way, if the data they collect and use helps their ability to govern then I am all for it.

-If the NSA collected less information, it could be more useful and usable.    
-Your Emails, much like music or physical letters, *should* be your own private property, even if they aren't now  
-I can't both agree that the NSA should collect this information and the NSA should do this legally, because they are collecting it illegally it is a logical fallacy  
-By agree to this, I take away other people's privacy rights, and that's not okay  
-There could be new data or ways of analyzing it that would more seriously violate privacy or give power, and this is setting a bad precedent  
-Mass surveillance is bad historically

48,CMV:Dota 2 is superior to League of Legends,TRUE,1,t3_3iq6j0,"Having played dota for 1 year, and Lol for 6 months before that i have come to the opinion that Dota 2 is a much better game in many facets. Not only is dota 2 completely free to play, the actual gameplay is better, and the graphics are much better.


-The Dota 2 map is larger and has more interesting features for vision and juking.


-Dota 2 has TP scrolls and a courier allowing for more interesting map movement.


-Dota 2 heroes have much more unique and scaled up abillities than LoL Champions.  Think techies vs teemo, and heroes like tinker, meepo, lone druid, invoker, etc.  LoL heroes typically have a couple skillshot nukes and a movement abillity as a rule of thumb.


-Denying, highground miss chance, and pulling/stacking make laning much more interesting in Dota.


-Ancients and Roshan are much more interesting high value targets than Dragon or Baron.


-Towers are much weaker in Dota, and smoke of deceit exists, allowing for much more aggressive gameplay.


-Dota heros are much more turbocharged, any dota hero ported exactly would be the strongest champion in League of Legends.


-Activatable items improve gameplay decisionmaking.  LoL items are boring and mostly just stat based.  Dota items allow for much more customizablility in item build and improvement in game play (blink dagger 18 second cooldown vs. flash 300 second cooldown).


Dota 2 has a higher barrier of entry in a style of game whose focus is improvement, and that might lead people to LoL, but given the massive time investment in either game this is basically irrelevent.

1154,CMV: Extreme hunters are morally equivalent to omnivores.,FALSE,0,t3_395yf9,"So-called 'extreme hunters' like giraffe killer Rebecca Francis regularly and deservedly receive public shaming, but few of us think twice about grinning at our lamb chops come dinner time.

No, this will not be another tired vegetarian diatribe; I want to pose the question as to why we humans seem to have a tendency to readily aboard the vigilante bandwagon for the giraffe killer but not the lamb killer. If both animals are equally peaceful and unthreatening to us (giraffes and lambs), what makes us react to Rebecca Francis with such vitriol but then react with such nonchalance to human omnivores, ourselves included?

There's no shortage of gruesome scenes being pictured in animal rights campaigns, so the macabre happy snaps next to the dead giraffe couldn't have been macabre only due to the dead animal being in frame. No, it was probably the fact this dead animal was a giraffe. I mean, come on! A giraffe! Who does that?! Well, perhaps we're simply unaccustomed to the idea of dead giraffes. It might be so far from 'normal' (to us) that it just makes it automatically wrong.

It's a bit like if I said I had intimate relations with my sister. For the record, I have no sister and so have had no such relations. But if I did, you'd probably say it was disgusting and unethical - but why? Couldn't there be some instances of incest which are moral? What if we'd used protection, were both adults at the time, fully consented to whatever standard, no one other than ourselves knew, and it didn't have any negative consequences whatsoever now or in the future? According to research by moral psychologist Jonathan Haidt, you're still more likely than not to react negatively to this scenario, despite there being few if any good reasons left for thinking so. Haidt termed this 'post-hoc rationalisation', our tendency to jump to an intuited moral answer and then come up with its justifications afterwards.

Have we merely intuited our moral outrage to Rebecca Francis' photo next to her long-necked victim? Partly, perhaps. If the economic world was flipped and our centres of global commerce and industry were in Africa, we might live in a society which farmed giraffes and wildebeest instead of sheep and cattle. In such a society, a dead lamb might set off the same reaction as a dead giraffe has in our society, it would be equally far from 'normal'.

Though this isn't just about what's normal and what's not. Part of our reaction was reasoned, not all of it was intuited - or, at least, our intuitions happened to be supported by good reasons in this instance. Online commentators reasonably posed questions like Where's the fun in killing a giraffe? and Can't you find enjoyment someplace else, perhaps where you're not killing?

What's intriguing about these questions is how easily they can be transposed to the act of eating lamb chops: where Rebecca Francis killed a giraffe for apparent mere enjoyment, many of us regularly participate indirectly in the killing of lambs for mere enjoyable sustenance. Where's the fun in killing a lamb? and Can't you find enjoyable sustenance someplace else, perhaps where you're not killing?

Now, I did promise this wouldn't get too preachy, so instead of dwelling on these questions, let's consider how and why this cognitive dissonance occurs.

For one thing, most of us who eat meat aren't directly involved in the killing or otherwise of the animal, whereas Ms Francis was (and seeing a grinning killer lying next to a carcass readily sets off emotional dials). And how could someone be happy about such a peaceful animal's death if it was only for that sake alone? At least lamb-eaters aren't necessarily happy about the death of the animal they're eating, but are merely happy about their culinary experience - a consequence of the animal's death.

However, if the experience of 'extreme hunting' is actually what Rebecca Francis is happy about (which seems likely), then her enjoyment isn't necessarily anything more than - like meat - a consequence of the animal's death.

If mass-produced lab meat was indistinguishable from 'real' meat, might we feel more comfortable hoeing into our lamb chops? I think so, and I think we'd care a lot less about Rebecca Francis' happy snap if it was taken next to a life-like robot giraffe.

181,CMV: I don't want Sanders to get the Dem nomination because I think he can't win a general election,TRUE,1,t3_3hfdqo,"So much Sanders hype on Reddit lately, yet despite some of the good ideas he has, I don't want him to win against Hilary for the nomination. Isn't he a really far left candidate? This is a country where Trump is #1 currently among Republicans, and to win the general election you have to appeal to moderates. I don't see how he can do that with a lot of the very liberal positions he's taken (not to mention his unabashed acceptance of the 'socialist' label), and my fear is that if some moderate Republican like Jeb Bush takes the nomination, he will win a general election in a landslide by taking all the centrist votes. Or am I being too pessimistic?

1036,"CMV:I think we should define ""man"" and ""woman"" biologically relating to sex organs/hormones",FALSE,0,t3_3a94t6,"Yes, another thread about transgender people on CMV.Sorry, if this particular view was already expressed and I also don't mean to offend anyone. I am in full support of people living their lives as they please and transitioning if they please.I also believe that gender dysphoria is an innate trait related to hormones and genes like homosexuality/bisexuality.


I had a discussion with one of my long time friends which was born with female genitalia and who identifies as male. This person often gets angry when people refer to him as ""she"" or a ""girl""(this person looks female). To him, he is a male, a transgender male.

Now,my understanding is that a transgender individual is one who doesn't identify as the sex they were assigned at birth.(Ex: feeling like you are a woman when you possess a penis and testicles)

To my friend being a man/male would basically be defined as the following.Personally, I found his definition circular,hence flawed, as it seemed he was using the very term he was trying to define within the definition.Man: Person who identifies as a man.

The arguments generally used against my stance of defining it according to sex organs are the grey areas one may encounter doing so, for example intersexed people.However, I'd argue a circular definition is worse than one with grey areas as it outright doesn't tell us what we're trying to define.Other responses seem to be that we ought to define according to neurology/psychology of individuals being more masculine/feminine, hence not using the ""X: Person who identifies as X"". However, I feel that a psychological portrait ( and hence neurological portrait) is going to generate a greater amount of grey areas than a general physiological one.I also don't understand why we would reject an account based on physiological properties like sex organs/hormones, but then use the brain instead which is a much more complex and less accessible system and hence harder to use for classification.

Definitions are not objective facts ,they are subjective association that we make between terms and concepts for the sole purpose mainly to facilitate discussion and communication. There is no logical reason ""a plane figure with four equal straight sides and four right angles."" as to be the term ""square"" anymore then it has to be term ""carré"".

I personally agree with what somebody else said on the issue of definitions in general ""there are no good or bad definitions just useful ones"" which. A definition should be as clear as possible, we should favor definition which are less vague. A definition should not be circular as it doesn't really tell us anything, how could we understand the definition fully  when the whole reason we are looking at it is because we're unaware of the sense of one of it's components?

1452,"CMV: ""Reverse racism"" is as real as any other kind of racism.",TRUE,1,t3_361db8,"Hey guys! Not too long ago, there was quite the controversy surrounding [this](http://edition.cnn.com/2015/05/13/living/feat-boston-university-saida-grundy-race-tweets/), and it spilled over into a Facebook debate amongst my fellow BU peers. It is here where I was made aware of the fact that, apparently, the dictionary definition of racism is pretty much obsolete, and —more shockingly— that women cannot be sexist against men, much like black people cannot be racist against white people. 

I feel that, like [Ludwig Wittgenstein](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wittgenstein/), the meaning of words lies on a shared commonality —be it community slang, or dictionary definitions— not on an individual's decision; e.g. I cannot expect that exclaiming ""look at that magnificent fan!"" should be interpreted by people as 'fan' meaning 'double rainbow', because that is not the agreed upon definition of 'fan.' [I use this example because it just seems to me that someone (presumably from tumblr or some radfem blog) decided to change the definition of racism— how convenient.]

So, change my view/educate me, because to me, racism is racism— regardless of the aggressor's race/skin color.

Edit 1: So, just to clarify: the 'reverse,' to me, is nonsense. As I understand it, it is called reverse because in the history of USA, the most well-known and most abundant cases of racism has been from white people onto others. I'm not saying that other people have not been racist towards whites, that would be nonsense. To me, however, racism is racism, and there's no need for the 'reverse.' What I was trying to get at, is that a black/Asian/Hispanic/[minority] person CAN be racist towards whites— because the definition of racism is irrespective of the aggressor's race.

Edit 2: Second clarification: by 'reverse racism' I mean that which is directed towards white people, as others have defined it— presumably because in the historical context of America, it has been white people who have harbored racism towards others.

679,"CMV: A Country's peace and economic prosperity should be placed before human rights e.g freedom of speech,freedom of press,individual privacy",FALSE,0,t3_3de9ry,"   Coming from Singapore,a country that has experienced tremendous growth from a 3rd world country to a first world country within a short period time there is no doubt there were many sacrifices made in the process.

   However it has also been noted by people from other countries (western countries in particular) that this growth was achieved partly due to the fact that we have placed our placed our economic prosperity and peace before our human rights. One prominent example of this would be our freedom of press which was ranked at 150 out of 180 countries. My government response to this was that in order to maintain social and racial harmony control over the media was necessary in order to prevent racial riot and social tension from occurring which would in turn weaken our economy. Personally after seeing the Baltimore riots, i started to understand the rationale behind some of their actions as i would definitely do not want my country to descend into chaos due to riots. Furthermore, after starting to work i have come to the realization sometimes putting food on the table is more important than the rights we have.

  In addition, to my surprise my government Media Development Agency (MDA) also monitor its people through the use of software provided by the Hacking Team( they have a company in singapore) . However, it seems like most singaporeans do not care if their country is monitoring their activities as i quote the common reply i get is '' I do not have anything to hide.So what should i be scared of?'' This mindset is very common as we feel that our country will only use the software to catch the bad people like terrorist and the invasion of our privacy is just for the greater good of the society so as to maintain peace and economic prosperity.

So i have come to the conclusion that in order to have peace and economic prosperity some sacrifices of our human rights is a necessary evil. Change my view reddit. Thanks

EDIT: Thanks for all the comments, it has definitely helped me to broaden my perspectives and i will try my best to reply to all your comments as soon as possible.

748,"CMV: College students are incredibly foolish, and deserve no pity for their poor decisions",FALSE,0,t3_3csaui,"In short, college students are absolute fools, and by and large deserve no pity for their stupidity. I understand what I’m saying is very contentious but allow me to try and explain without sounding like an arrogant jerk (I’ll fail, but whatever). One of the most frustrating things I see in the news is the ridiculous debate over “rape-culture” on college campuses as if they’re full of malicious serial rapists and murderers. Now, I’ll admit I am a member of a large social fraternity at my school, a highly ranked university in California with ~40,000 students, so let the bias be noted. I want to first point out that this “debate” is absurd, there is an imaginary opposition to the idea that rape and rape-culture is bad. You won’t find rallies supporting rape or anyone (of course a few but exceptionally rare) suggesting that rape is acceptable. What the debate clearly stems from is the idea that rape and sexual assault is some liquid term with varying boundaries. A man having sex with a drunk girl is considered rape by some people and to be fine by others. Those saying it is rape see the opposition as suggesting any drunk girl is conscientious “asking for it” and likewise those saying it is normal see the other side as suggesting being drunk rids you of responsibility for your actions. This creates an intense debate despite the fact that they all agree on the same fundamental principle. 
	
With that out of the way, let’s talk about the behavior of college students. As I said before I am in a fraternity and the ridiculous nonsense I see every week of the school year is beginning to weigh on me. I have seen a girl give head on a dancefloor in our house surrounded by hundreds of people, I have been assaulted by random guys drunk as hell, I have had to physically remove several guys because they’re pissing in the corner of a room. Of course, we’re totally asking for all of this I suppose is the first thing that comes to most people’s minds. We throw parties, we supply alcohol, we play the music and turn on the blacklights. Who am I to look down upon the result of my creation? And the answer is that I don’t, if I didn’t enjoy it I wouldn’t be taking part in it. What bothers me however is the incredible entitlement and utter lack of dignity these people have. That girl I saw railing a line of coke and pounding away 3 shots out of a plastic handle? Oh it’s her life, who are you to judge! That guy shattering a window on the second floor? Oh you shouldn’t have given him alcohol, shame on you for throwing an unsafe party. 
	
What I have come to realize is that most students are absolute idiots, at least on the weekends. One caveat, yes I may just be around the wrong crowds, but I would say with complete confidence that at least a third of the student body engages in the type of idiotic garbage I’m talking about. How does this relate to rape? If it isn’t obvious, it is because I end up being the victim. These attitudes and opinions sincerely make me scared to have sex with a girl, because I know just being in a fraternity will make me guilty of rape before I can even open my mouth to defend myself. I find it unbelievable that there is such a stigma against, let’s be honest, men in college. I have to hear about it all day, how dangerous it is to go to a fraternity party, how you’ll get drugged and taken advantage of. Well let me tell you a vast majority of the girls found in these places will drug themselves before any guy even gets the chance. I see girls get black-out drunk and f**k anyone that looks their direction every other weekend and I ask myself, “is this the same type of girl I see ranting and raving that just because she was drunk means she didn’t consent?” It is becoming increasingly hard for me to believe that they aren’t one in the same. Okay, okay I’ve been too anti-female, but believe me I think the guys are just as bad. I have heard of six people getting DUIs in my four years here in college. SIX DUIs, and a few drug related charges. What makes these people think this is acceptable is beyond me, but at least they will reap what they sow, I suppose.
	
This has probably been hard to follow, but I can sum it up pretty simply. While I’m sure plenty are sincere, and my heart goes out to them, I find so many self-victimizing claims of college students to be farcical. At this point I just don’t feel pity for the kid next to me in class facing a jail sentence for drug possession, or the girl freaking out because she is now known as the girl who banged five guys on the roof in one night. 

Beyond having pity I’m angered by the fact these poor decisions end up being blamed on me. Let it be known to the world, because surprisingly no one seems to understand this, your university knows EXACTLY what happens at fraternity houses and they support it. They know underage drinking is everywhere they know the drugs are there. They know several of the fraternities “haze” and simply do not care. The police department knows as well, do you think they are ignorant of the massive weekly house parties? Knowing all of this and with absolute agency to stop these organizations from existing they allow it, because universities see the benefit in the greek system for promoting social events for students. Despite this, even if we don’t serve alcohol at a party if some idiot comes drunk we’re going down. We aren’t offered the fair treatment bars or venues receive even though we serve the same function. The system basically works like this: The university knows well of all activities and events and they allow them while publicly stating they are against underage drinking, hazing, and the like. But if or when something goes wrong like let’s say someone gets alcohol poisoning, the university and police department come crashing down on the organizations they support to save face and place all blame on the members. My reputation and life is under threat because I participate in something innocuous that is constantly scapegoated.

107,CMV: Donald Trump would be a bad president,TRUE,1,t3_3i3wn7,"Donald Trump is a decent businessman who inherited his capital. He's a punchline. A rich punchline, but a punchline all the same.

His views on immigration would not only alienate the countries south and north of the border, essentially saying they can't be trusted not to ""send"" their criminals here, but it would make us look paranoid to the rest of the world. People can come to the U.S. as tourists from several countries, not just Mexico, completely legally. They then can slip into the sea of people and stay, illegally. The problem with illegal immigration is much more complex than he seems to realize.

The man has no foreign policy experience. Boardroom deals with businessmen and bureaucrats from another country does not equate to nation-to-nation diplomacy.

His national defense ideas that I've heard seem to amount to, ""more guns and let's tell other countries to screw off.""

The Democrats' stance that the rich want to influence policy to get richer does not exclude Donald Trump. Who is to say he wouldn't endorse policies that would make it easier for both him and his kids to double their fortune?

223,CMV: You shouldn't own a dog.,TRUE,1,t3_3h13pq,"I think you probably shouldn't own a dog - except maybe you are blind, an old-school shepherd or train them for finding people after avalanches or earthquakes. I have several reasons to holdthis view - here they are, sorted by relevance (from least to most relevant). 

* They eat poo.
* They are annoying. Many people have really strong opinions against smoking in public, because it is upsetting them and accordingly laws have been past in many countries that limit/prohibit smoking in public transport, public buildings, etc. However, it is not uncommon to be leg-humped by a dog in the bus, or step into dog-poo in the park, which I find really annoying. This seems to be regarded as unproblematic, some pepole even get annoyed if you do not want to touch their animal companion with questionable hygiene standards.* You may say that (contrary to smoking) these are merely inconveniences, but in fact...
* ...Some dogs are plain dangerous. Have a look at the [""Fatal dog attacks""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatal_dog_attacks_in_the_United_States) wiki entry. Granted, there are MUCH more people dying from cars, cigaretts, cancer (and that's only deadly stuff with a C), etc. but in my opinion even one person would be too much. There are a lot of young children on the list as well. 
* My rant so far may have given you the opinion that I just hate animals. However, the opposite is true - I love them! Therefore I think we shouldn't keep them for our amusement or because we fancy a walk once or twice a day. 
* They eat. In a world where people are starving this is in my opinion morally not justifiable. 
* Most importantly: They produce greenhouse gases - and quite a lot of them! [The co2-""paw print"" of a big dog that gets fed mostly meat may even be bigger than the emissions caused by an SUV.](http://www.salon.com/2014/11/20/the_surprisingly_large_carbon_paw_print_of_your_beloved_pet_partner/)

Therefore I am convinced that you probably shouldn't own a dog. I will not be convinced by single examples where a dog was useful, but by reasons why the overall benefits of private dog-owenership surpass the negetive effects I have listed above. Please CMV!

(*)The fanatic dog-loving may be an issue particular to Germany.



**EDIT: Deltas have been awarded to the argument that dogs ""sage lives"" by providing companionship, and helping with mental as well as physical health issues. It may therefore be argued that these safed lives make up for the harm that dogs cause elsewhere. Thanks to /u/stoopydumbut, /u/RustyRook, and /u/jiw123. (Others have also made the same point later). Thanks for the interesting discussion. At the very least I learned that I am pretty alone in my distaste for dog poo :)**

**EDIT 2: Ok, it's 3am where I am and I think all arguments that can be made about the issue have been made. Good night and thanks again for the discussion!**

37,CMV: Not knowing her age should be a defense against statutory rape in some cases.,TRUE,1,t3_3ivtqs,"Hi guys! 

Let me start out by saying that I believe I understand the reasons behind statutory rape. Many different cultures define adulthood differently, but in most childhood is defined as a time where the person has a psuedo-agency. They're a person but they can only make certain decisions. Age of consent laws are based upon this.

I completely agree. I like romeo and juliet clauses but in general I think this way of thinking and justification is spot-on.

I think it's 110% absurd though to apply this in situations where the minor meets their statutory rapist in an adult-restricted zone (in this case a zone designated for anybody above the relevant age of consent). This means 18+ clubs, 21+ bars, even 16+ shows where it takes place in a region where the age of consent is 16+.

*This isn't a moral argument, it's a legal one*. I think it's so bizarre to expect adults in these areas to ""be on guard"". If anybody should be charged, it should be the venue that let them in due to negligence. I don't even know what to think about fraudulent IDs.

I understand this isn't a super common occurrence, that typically it's parents who file charges and that minors aren't usually acting as weird predators. It's not about frequency, just that it exists.

I'm not sure how easy it will be to change my view. I do know that I completely don't understand any arguments for this line of thought. I might just be confused. It just doesn't make sense to me. Maybe something will click.

EDIT: I'm not sure how to make an edit to the title, but I'd rather have it be genderless. Sorry about that.
EDIT2: My view has been changed multiple times over! I'm gonna stop with the deltas. Thank you everyone who helped! :)

880,CMV: I think it's OK for politicians to change their public stance on issues.,TRUE,1,t3_3bnf96,"Same-Sex marriage in the US is one of the ""hottest"" news stories of June, and many people are upset that some politicians (especially democratic ones) have gone from being against same-sex marriage to being for it, with statements often pointing to the (likely true) idea that their stance is based on public opinion. 

However, I don't think we should be denouncing these politicians for changing their views on issues such as this one. We should actually *encourage* politicians to do so, *especially* when they change their views based on public opinion. Is this not a representative democracy? Isn't the whole point of a representative democracy for our representatives to actually *represent* the public's views on issues? 

This isn't a CMV about whether politicians *really* change their views based on our opinion (I've seen the data; often times they act against the majority opinion due to lobbying efforts).  I just think that it's OK *if* politicians change their view based on public opinion. CMV.",880,TRUE,1,TRUE,1
957,CMV: The US military budget should be diverted into projects that aim to fix the world.,FALSE,0,t3_3awugt,"""Each javelin round costs about $80,000, and the idea that it's fired by a guy who doesn't make that in a year, at a guy who doesn't make that in his lifetime is somehow so outrageous that it almost makes this war seem winnable""

-Sebastian Junger

The [US military budget](http://www.globalissues.org/article/75/world-military-spending) for both 2011 and 2012 was around $690 billion ($690,000,000,000). This money is wasted on overpriced training, equipment and massacres for a war that is helping no-one. The ""earth's 6th big extinction event"" scare is doing the rounds and regardless of its scientific legitimacy, there is little doubt that the world is on a course for annihilation. However, I would argue that the world is not doomed and could be brought back to a state of balance (more or less) with the right funding in areas such as sustainable energy, global education and environmental rehabilitation. Unfortunately that funding is going towards America's collosal erection for blowing brown people up.

525,CMV: No sport takes less skill than golf,TRUE,1,t3_3epjfs,"I am a fan of many sports, and all of them seem to take a lot of skill. But golf has always been the one I hated. It's always been boring to me, and it seems that when compared to other sports, golf takes the least skill. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not saying professional golfers aren't extremely talented, golf is not easy, but compared to anything else, it's nothing. In every other sport, your skill set has to be very large, and you have to be very good at many things. Baseball for instance; you need to be able to bat, field and run. In soccer, you need to be fast, be able to pass, and shoot. In basketball, again, you need to be fast, be able to pass, and be able to shoot. But in golf, you just have to be able to hit a ball towards the hole, and you can only do that one way.

The idea that we will “use up all the Earth’s resources” is short-sighted. The cost to space is falling as technology advances, and space is full of energy and materials. It will eventually be economical to go get it.

Also, old waste becomes new resources as technology changes. Dung became fertilizer. Dirt  became bricks. Sand became glass. Guano became gunpowder. Asphalt became roads.

1114,CMV: Animal rights cannot be adequately addressed unless we recognize our cultural biases.,FALSE,0,t3_39iq1o,"- big game hunting 
- eating pork 
- killing venomous snakes 
- dog fights 
- eating mass produced meats and eggs** 
- wearing leather and fur 
- dog breeding 
- rat-baiting 
- horse racing 
- cock fights 
- fishing

How we see these activities, which all (can) hurt living things, is always influenced by culture AND personal values. It's not a mistake that the activities that are illegal and/or most popularly hated in the US are those associated with the poor or with cultures unfamiliar to most americans. Another factor is the cuteness of the animal (I have a soft spot for snakes and insects so I notice this)-- The popular, often almost gleeful, condemnation some of these activities is inseparable from hatred of outsiders and the oppressed.

For those who cherish animal life in a less arbitrary way it could seem like, this blood-thirsty mob has, for once taken, the correct side. But, this is an illusion-- we are are harmed by the inconsistency and emotion-driven fervor of these people who would suggest hanging as punishment for dog fights, then blithely eat chicken from a large producer, or smile at photos of their uncle posed with half-dead and suffocating sword fish.

I think there are important questions here, I don't have the answers either. My point is not that all of these actions are equivalent, but rather that they have more in common than many people care to acknowledge. I would not be sad to live in a meatless, leather-free future, it might make me feel old, like someone's homophobic grandma who tries, but can't quite shake deeply learned prejudice. But, I think we have no choice but to recognize the cruelty in our own culture as, at least, similar to the cruelty found in other cultures. Most people I know personally who care about these issues already think about this rather deeply, so my criticisms are not for them. Many animal rights activists *do* see the parallels but it is hard to hear their intelligent arguments over the din consisting of little but mad-vitriol over certain animals (especially dogs) being harmed in certain ways. This level of anger that never seems to show up for pigs, snakes and fish-- or for the actions of male hunters (but women who hunt can get death threats) much of this comes from people who, like me, use leather, kill and eat fish (or think it's normal) and buy products like eggs or bacon.

This consistency issue is a big deal to me because calling an action cruel in one context but normal or a sport in another speaks to an unwillingness to contemplate life from diverse perspectives. And there are so many things we ought to be questioning... beyond the torture of fish.

This critical moral question about how and if we can end much of this cruelty deserves an answer from humans who recognize the common joys and failings of each other. It should not be arbitrary, the result of cultural preferences.

1330,CMV: Charities are a stop-gap solution that exists solely to prolong the social issues created and perpetuated by government and corporate interests.,FALSE,0,t3_375xh2,"Society is held together by tape. This tape is the estimated [1.5 million charities](http://foundationcenter.org/getstarted/faqs/html/howmany.html) in the U.S. which offer a range of services to people who have ""fallen in the cracks"" of social policies: the people who the system has failed.

Physically sick, mentally ill, drug addicted people all rely on charitable institutions, either directly for care, or through research programs funded by donations.

These organisations are funded by private donations, and 

* Relief of the poor, the distressed, or the underprivileged,
* Advancement of religion,
* Advancement of education or science,
* Construction or maintenance of public buildings, monuments, or works,
* Lessening the burdens of government,
* Lessening of neighborhood tensions,
* Elimination of prejudice and discrimination,
* Defense of human and civil rights secured by law, and
* Combating community deterioration and juvenile delinquency.

All of which *should* fall in the domain of the government's responsibilities. The government is effectively outsourcing their social duties to a range of private organisations so that they can mop up the social outfall from government policies such as: 

* War
* Poor healthcare
* Poor consumer protection
* Poor social policies (schooling, social programs etc.)
* Poor prison system 

All of which are outsourced to private organizations.

I believe that if NGO's in the U.S. ceased exist, society would fall apart.

The role of an NGO is effectively to create a barrier between increasingly destructive government/corporate behaviour and utter societal collapse.

970,"CMV: The Prestige, the machine does not work. Spoiler alert.",FALSE,0,t3_3askwy,"I will start by I have struggled with this concept since it has been brought to my attention. I know this movie extremely well, better than I should, and have previously debated just about every scene. Not to say the this conclusion is right but to say I do know the film and the characters well. 



My basic theory stems from, The movie constantly allures to what and how magic is done, which has nothing to do with 'real magic' but with deceit. That's what the machine is deceit.  Will give  a summary of my theory now, leaving out the beginning and end, and details as my post will be too long for any interest. I will elaborate on the beginning and end , and details once the discussion begins.



So Borden does have a twin, tesla is real, angiers visits are fabricated from the diary and his ending speech being as such. Upon Angier capturing Fallon and receiving the key to Borden's diary(tesla) is where I will start. Angier visits Tesla finding out there is no answer to Borden's secret( Angiers original motive), and tesla has no ""magic"". So he begins to come up with away to frame Borden, not just kill him, but ruin his reputation and acquire custody of his daughter. He uses the fact Borden has sent him to tesla, to begin his frame up. He uses a useless tesla machine to add flair to an old trick, and spark interest in Borden. Angier also needs ""real magic"" to obtain a theater, no simple trick will do, as Borden hs already ruined his reputation. He uses a double to pull off his trick, with the illusion of being transported. He doesn't drown his double every night just the night of the murder. To ensure Borden will be confused he uses the element of mysterious tanks being transported from the theater every night, otherwise Borden will easily see he is using a double but with the mysterious tanks he sparks enough interest from Borden to want to see backstage, as this is vital for the frame up to work. 



Angier is the pledge and turn and root(or other double if you prefer) is the prestige, ie on the balcony. Angiers motive at this point is no longer magic or the applause it's simply to frame borden. Borden makes multiple appearances at the show wearing a disguise. Angier needs to spot and identify this disguise in order to carry on with the frame up, which is why he doesn't do the frame up the first night he enters the theater, and eventually Angier does discover Borden. Knowing his routine and the fact he will come again because he hasn't been picked to view the machine or backstage, he sets the frame up. Seeing Borden enter the theater he tells his assistant to pick Borden out of the crowd that night, also telling root he will be the pledge and turn for the transported man ( not the other tricks) on this night. As Borden is being picked from the crowd, Angier and root switch, the frame up plays out Angier flees the theater. This is the jist will elaborate further on the end scene and the like upon the discussion beginning.



I will add a few of the questions about the machine working theory that I have, which can be answered by my theory. These questions could be preluded with ""if the machine works""



What is the tank Caine and Angier are pushing during the ending scene? If if the last clone is in the morgue, and the tank had been broken to extract the clone what tank are they pushing?



Why store the clones? What not rid of them every night?


What is the air bubble at the end in the only visible tank.



How did Angier gain full control of both his legs while drowning? The movie goes through some length to show how damaged it is, why do this if it's not meant to be.a clue



If Borden sends angiers to tesla, it's his plan, why wait till he has  captured Fallon to give him Teslas name, why not give it to him when he gives Angier the diary?



I have more of my theory to share, and more question to ask those who disagree it this is already too long. Looking for reasonable, logical, light hearted debate, so bring it on reddit change my views

1140,CMV: Student loan interest rates should correlate with the major and type of school someone attends,TRUE,1,t3_39ba8x,"From what I understand, student loan interest rates are very high because everyone has to pay for those that default (in addition to the gvt making money off of it). If someone is taking a riskier educational path, such as going to art school, which has less of a chance to pay back those loans, then they should pay a higher interest rate than those professions that are almost guaranteed to pay the loans back, such as someone going to medical school. The gist of my argument is that it would cause people to reconsider what they are majoring in and make sure they learn a skill that can be used in the real world; ie makes money",1140,TRUE,1,FALSE,0
953,"CMV: In a fantasy world where the dead can rise, burial wouldn't be common",FALSE,0,t3_3azr30,"That occurred to me when I played witcher 3. In that game, the dead not only can rise in the form of drowners and wraiths but can also be food for other types of dangerous monsters like ghouls. In fact, most cemeteries are very dangerous places for that reason and yet, still, every village has one.

In other fantasy worlds where zombies are also commonplace people still bury bodies just to have them rise a few days/months latter.

In any society that experienced supernatural phenomena related to the dead, I believe the dead would almost certainly be burned. Maybe a very few selection of people (kings and the elite) could have the ""burial"" privileges but that would be very few. The vast majority of the common folk would not do that.

As a matter of fact, even in our world when there is danger due to corpses (like in a big plague) mass burnings start. If the corpse would rise for brains I can't possibly see how anyone would just bury someone.

I'm not a very spiritual person. And I don't believe in a lot 'outside' of what we can percieve. Yes I believe there's more to the world, but I don't believe in anything beyond biological sex. Of course it's not binary. Intersex people very obviously exist, that's just scientific fact.

259,"CMV: As a Vietnamese, sometimes I wish the America won the Vietnam War",TRUE,1,t3_3gp6g1,"Look, I know this is a touchy subject, and while people might say I'm young and didn't understand the complexity of wars, just hear me out.  
  
Vietnam was essentially a communist state, due to influences from China and USSR, which were alliances (the former is debatable) of Vietnam during the war. After the war, our country has suffered multiple economic depressions, and famines due to the incompetence of our liberally named Communist Party. Granted the South Vietnam government wasn't any better, but what the U.S wanted for Vietnam was for the best.  
  
I understand that, technically the US did not wage war with our people, but stood against the spread of communism in Asia, and with our strategic location, a battle surely followed. The US did not deliberately invaded our country. And look at what they did to the world. ~~Defeated the Nazis and fascist countries~~, uplifted South Korea, Japan (which were both smaller and less resourceful than my country) to their respectable position on the world map today. And what had the sole communist party in my country done? Nothing but left our people in the struggle of a third-world country. And China is still brazenly harassing our borders and seas to this very day, just because our army is incapable of standing up for themselves.  
  
~~Please tell me if I was wrong and why the North won was a good idea.~~  
  
Edit: My view has changed. It was not simple as I thought it was. Generally it can be summarized into those points: involvement of China, motives and war crimes committed by the US, and there was no hope in the governing system. Communism has not helped our people a bit, but no one can really advocates for America either. We as a nation should look to develop our own path. Insights are still very much appreciated.

1173,CMV: Cyberbullying isn't a problem,TRUE,1,t3_38zcbm,"I should start out by saying i didn't exactly word the title to the best of my ability, but it reflects my point of view better than any other way i could think of wording it. before i say anything else, i should set a general definition as to what cyberbullying refers to in this conversation. 
&gt;""Cyberbullying"" is when a person is tormented, threatened, harassed, humiliated, embarrassed or otherwise targeted by another person using the Internet, interactive and/or digital technologies.

I don't believe this should be an issue at all, or at least not what the media makes it out to be. In the ""real world"", when someone is being bullied they cannot avoid it. this is usually because of two issues: 1. they lack the power to stop a bully. Ex: They are not strong enough to stop a physical harasser. 2. they cannot change the ""scenario"". Ex: A bully in the same class cannot be avoided.

Online, neither of those issues are present. Bullies hold no physical power and cannot touch you. If they continuously bother you, there are many ways to avoid them. simply by blocking them, changing servers (if present in a game), or by taking a break from using your computer.

I want to make it clear that cyberbullying is different than using technology to ruin someone's life. Using a mobile phone to record something bad and blackmail someone would be physically bullying them. Telling someone to kill themselves on league of legends is ""cyberbullying"". 

I would love to hear what reddit has to say about this topic, i've always scoffed at the idea of cyberbullying and thought of it as another way people like to complain about nothing. Maybe i'm not seeing something. Is cyberbullying unavoidable? is it a serious issue? should anyone even care? Let's talk about it.

204,CMV: it is normal for adults to be attracted to people who are in their late teens.,FALSE,0,t3_3h8ell,"I did not know this was an unpopular opinion until recently. Basically my stance is as follows.

People in their late teens are fully physically developed and have all the qualities that other adults find sexually appealing. They are sexual beings both physically and mentally. So it is evident to me that the Natural Order of Things supports my view.

Feel free to correct me if I am wrong but, for all of human history up until recently people regularly married people in their late teens and they were seen as adults. I think the change in perception can be attributed to three things:

1. People now marry later in life, the norm in this culture is to sleep around when they are younger. Adding on to that...

2. We have a hookup culture. In the past people may have been more serious about relationships (feel free to correct me if I am wrong) but nowadays a lot of people just hook up and marry when they want to ""settle down"" later in life. As a result people more readily assume that anyone interested in a younger person is up to no good and isn't serious. Which is probably the source of aversion to this kind of attraction; because they want to protect them.

3. People nowadays do not consider people in their late teens to be adults while in the past they were. I think this could be a result of how present society coddles people even through their college years whereas many later-year teens have the potential to be a functional adult with a job, spouse and kids if raised differently. Probably a result of people getting married later in life which is a result of promiscuity due to culture and availability of contraception.

Furthermore I would actually assert that forbidding relationships based on age, given that both are ready physically and mentally for that kind of relationship, is immoral; because you are stepping in the way of love, no one is getting hurt (besides pain of breakup if that happens), etc.

So basically the only thing I see that supports the argument against my view is that culture opposes it. While culture and soceity's rules may be influenced by truth, they are arbitrary. Society's rules are nothing in the face of objective truth (refer to my statement about the Natural Order of Things above) If they are not molded after it already. Adding on to this, I've heard (again, feel free to correct me if I am wrong) that women's brains become fully mature at ~17 and men's brains become fully mature at ~23. Its why in the past, men were legally considered minors at a later age than women were. If you make the argument that someone cannot rightfully enter a relationship with an adult until their brain is fully mature, you would be forced to also agree that ~17 y/o women should be available and that men should not be available until ~23. My own solution to this is that maturity in decision making is not wholly dependent on this one variable. Many adults don't make very ""adult"" decisions and many teens make responsible, ""adult"" decisions. This is, instead, something to assess regarding the individual, which applies to people 20+ as well.

Also I do not believe that such relationships hurt anyone by default. One person may be more inexperienced but that is a vulnerability that the other person does not have to exploit if they are a decent human being after the right thing.

A bit of context: I'm a 21 y/o college student and do find myself attracted to people in their late teens, as well as adults. I feel that this is normal and natual and not a fetish or somehing that is uncommon. I do not get off on domination or whatever like some people think those who have this attraction do. I just find that my brain recognizes those people as fellow adults. I'm also not looking to hook up, I'm a actually abstaining from sex until marriage and take all my relationships seriously; no ""spring flings"" or whatever for me.

My grandparents met and started dating when grandma was 16 and grandpa was 21. They were and are both very happy and have a good marriage. Imagine if they had dismissed each other as unavailable or were prevented from being together. (Refer to how I said that this kind of prevention is immoral).

ELI5 TLDR: People in their late teens many times cannot be differentiated from other ""adults"" if you did not know their age. So it is normal to be attracted to them and the current taboo is only a recent, arbitrary social rule based on nothing more than culture.

65,"CMV: The journalist who trolled Trump, a Presidential candidate, during a press conference should be fired by Univision and shunned by the rest of us",FALSE,0,t3_3ijkbw,"A journalist's job is to report the news, not to create them. Ramos made himself a news item when he trolled presidential candidate Donald Trump during a press conference. Political statements, being unruly, and making accusations does not constitute journalism and not why Univision sent him there. The press conference was not there to allow journalists to express their feelings about issues.  After such unprofessional behavior became public and a national news item, Ramos should've been fired immediately.

I'm not a fan of Trump, I would not vote for him, and I don't think he'll get the nomination.  However, whether you hate him or not, trolling a presidential candidate during a press conference is an embarrassment to the nation, makes a mockery of out our democratic process, and coming from a journalist, should lead to a dismissal.

If we instead agree that trolling presidential candidates is OK if they had it coming, then it opens the floodgates to anyone who dislikes a candidate to disrupt our democratic process. Who decides when a candidate can be disrupted or not?

People mostly agree that the activists who disrupted Sanders were out of line, but when it's Trump, it's ok?

The presidential race is an extremely important one for this nation and should be treated seriously and with respect.

793,CMV: An increase in the minimum wage would hurt only the lower and middle classes,TRUE,1,t3_3cemxp,"Over the last few years, and especially now with the popularity of Bernie Sanders, a heavily debated subject is the raising of the minimum wage to $15/hour. While many would expect this to strengthen the lower class and only decreasing the wealth of the upper class, I feel as if it would end up hurting those it is meant to help.   
  
These company's would now have to spend much more of their budget on paying employees, and it's not as if they're going to magically have more money. I understand that the increase of wealth in the lower class would eventually circulate back to the business's, but I highly doubt it would be enough to make up for the increased wages of their employees, and it definitely wouldn't happen right away. Since I highly doubt the CEO or other upper management would take cuts from their pay to make up for this, that leaves two possible solutions that I can see: 
  
The first would be to decrease the amount of employees. If approximately an equal percentage of employees are let go to the increase in pay the company will be able to function without upper management having to take a pay cut. While those who are able to keep there jobs would be greatly helped by this, for the most part it would just increase the unemployment rate; with these lay offs happening in a large portion of minimum wag paying company's there would be no demand for jobs while the supply would be sky rocketing. 
  
The other solution would be for the company to increase prices (for retail/restaurants). With increasing prices nobody would have to loose their job, however it would still end up hurting the lower class. Practically all people get there basic necessities and luxuries from retail and grocery stores- the lower and middle classes especially rely heavily on major stores such as Walmart or Target. Even if your paycheck is increasing you'd still end up paying more the things you already buy, taking a large chunk of your paycheck. 
  
While ideally an increased minimum wage seems perfect, it would in reality end up creating a combination of these two things. I'm sure I didn't hit on some points, so please try to change my view on this, I, as a minimum wage employee myself, would love to have a good reason to support raising it.

EDIT: ∆ Okay, my views been changed. I still don't think something as drastic as upping it to $15/hour right away would be a good idea, but I think a gradual increase could be really good. The biggest things that helped my view change were the historical instances of MW rising, the average proportion of price increase vs. wage increase, as well as the fact that businesses are already operating with the minimum number of employees and that jobs wouldn't just become expendable.

1218,CMV: Social Justice Warriors are obnoxious and harmful to the very cause that they champion.,FALSE,0,t3_38ezgc,"So, here's the thing.  I believe myself to be very liberal.  I am for the ideas of Social Justice, but I am really sick of reading about ""trigger warning"" this and ""safe space"" that.  I think that people who fall into the ""SJW"" stereotype tend to be flavor of the week armchair activists who like to yell and scream about social issues they aren't even remotely connected to, which really only gives fuel to the opposite view's fire.  Articles like [this one](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/opinion/sunday/judith-shulevitz-hiding-from-scary-ideas.html?_r=0) really punctuate how absurd some of this has gotten.  It frustrates me, because I do think we need to have a dialogue about racial inequality, gender issues, etc, but it just seems to me that these people who [""refuse to enact the labor""](https://melissafong.wordpress.com/2014/04/04/why-suey_park-wont-enact-the-labour-women-of-colour-dont-owe-you-an-education/) of explaining why their debate opponent's viewpoint is allegedly invalid are just making people who actually care and actually need the change look a little silly.   

Anyway, I would like to better understand these people so that I can engage with the ones in my sphere of influence and help guide their energy towards effective discourse that actually might affect change.   


Edit:  Ok, so the term SJW isn't really specific enough, and I'm having trouble articulating exactly what I mean, but some folks who are smarter than me have kind of hit the nail on the head with what I was trying to say.  u/unicornpeen (heh, reddit is ridiculous) and u/TBFProgrammer below have espoused their own opinions, and I agree with what they are saying.

408,"CMV: Nonviolence doesn't work. Excessive violence, especially killing or enslaving children, is proven to be the most effective military tactic and is justified for a sufficiently noble cause.",TRUE,1,t3_3fj7xw,"Nonviolence is how the establishment asks us to seek redress when at the same time they use violence against the common people. Your brother got shot by a cop? How dare you even *think* about so much as shooting a cop's brother. This is ridiculous and ineffective; the few times that nonviolence has actually been successful it has occurred in the face of greater violence. The peaceful dissipation of the British Empire occurred not because of Gandhi's or Nkrumah's fortitude but instead because the horrors of the Second World War made Blighty respect African and Asian fighters as their equals on the battlefield. When you're dealing with an establishment that sees both Jamal from Ferguson and Voula from Lesvos as equally dispensable, there is no way to nonviolently deconstruct this system.

On the contrary, violence against children has proven to be one of the most enduringly successful tactics; as heinous as it is in the microcosm, in the macrocosm it yields very successful results for a noble cause. One can see this in the Old Testament, where the Israelites showed no compunctions towards killing small children and were rewarded with a defensible state, and in modern times the success of the State of Israel as well. You see the same in ISIS; they show depraved indifference towards civilian life and as a result their enemies shut down because their lizard brain cannot condemn a baby-killer. If those who fight against imperialists (in the US, Europe, Canada, Ukraine -- both sides are imperialist scum -- etc) used the same tactic, the global system would not see the threat they faced until it was too late.

314,"CMV: Even for conservatives in both Israel and the US, there is no good reason to oppose the Iran Deal except for political capital.",TRUE,1,t3_3g99jt,"If we (the US) don't sign the deal and then a war ensues (which assumes Iran is actually developing a nuclear weapon and conservatives in the both the US and Israel aren't bluffing), we will look bad. We will be the ones who sabotaged our own diplomatic efforts (that the US spearheaded, hurting our reputation and clout abroad) and who preemptively started a war that will take not only Iranian lives, but also likely Israeli and even American lives. We will be the aggressors who forsook a diplomatic solution for a likely disastrous war in a region that can hardly afford any more instability. We will lose our allies, and be seen as weaker than if we had not made a deal.

Now, if we do sign the deal and Iran continues to develop a nuclear weapon in violation of the agreement and the aforementioned war does come to pass, the onus of starting the war falls on Iran for they are the ones who broke the agreement they signed and built a nuclear weapon despite they continued insistence that they are not, have not, and will never do so. They will be the ones to draw the condemnation and ire of the world, knowing full well the military consequences of building a nuclear bomb (which, on a side note, they will never actually use). Strategically, even for the conservative, the Iran deal is a win-win, and any opposition to it is either for short term political gain or born out of strategic myopia.

575,CMV: There is nothing wrong with requiring (medically-appropriate) vaccination for children to attend public schools,TRUE,1,t3_3eai2b,"Recently I've heard a lot about mandatory vaccination schemes in public schools. I don't see any problem with them. I've heard a few counterarguments, but they seem unsatisfying to me, for example:

1. My child, my choice. Well, yes. And this is the closest one to a valid argument, IMO. But of course we put limits on what parents are allowed to do and choose for their children; you can't deprive your child of food or education (in the US) and be allowed to keep your child, so clearly it is NOT all your choice. While refusing vaccines is nowhere near on that level, not EVERY possible choice is equally acceptable, because your child is a person, not a piece of property. If the child had the capacity to refuse, I might be swayed, but unfortunately young babies can't understand vaccines on any reasonable level. And, more importantly, it IS still your choice under school vaccination schemes; you can choose to homeschool your child, or send them to private schools that don't care. Those choices aren't available to everyone and that's unfortunate (for far more important reasons than this), but...that's our current system anyway. Being rich gets you all kinds of benefits. I don't think this is different from being able to buy better medical care, better schools, better food, private tutors, and worlds more for your child if you have the resources (I do support basic income, which would alleviate this issue, but that's neither here nor there as we haven't got it). Public schools are a governmental service, and there are rules about who can and cannot use them. I think it is fine to say only vaccinated (or medically exempt) people can use them.

2. Not everyone can get vaccinated. That's why doctors are able to issue waivers for those not medically right for vaccination. This already happens and should continue.

3. Vaccines are dangerous. Not as dangerous as rampant infection. Honestly this is its own debate...But suffice it to say you are going to need some pretty major evidence to possibly CMV. I don't think it exists, but I won't rule it out. I don't really want to talk about vaccine efficacy as it has been done to death, but I guess if there's some truly amazing evidence...

4. Everyone is entitled to an education. They still are. Any unvaccinated child either needs to attend a non-public education option, be homeschooled or eschooled, provide a medical certificate that says they shouldn't be vaccinated, or get the shots. I don't necessarily have a strong view on the best way to handle noncompliance, and don't know enough about policy to say what would be most effective and just. Maybe fines for the parents? The same punishment as parents who refuse to send their kids to school or teach them at home for other reasons? I would not support removing the child from the home or incarcerating the parents, or any other severe punishment.

What would change my view: evidence that such a policy would have clear public health risks, would unavoidably keep children from getting an education, or would have some other major negative effect on society. I also am open to the idea that it is fundamentally unjust, though it doesn't seem that way to me right now.

Edit: My post focuses mainly on why I think mandatory vaccination isn't bad, but it occurred to me that it might be helpful to say why I think it's good. Mainly, I think it's good because it protects those who cannot be vaccinated and the minority of children for whom the vaccine was ineffective or wore off sooner than it ""should have"" based on medical guidelines. Children should be safe at school, and I think this promotes safety in a significant way--since children can die of preventable illness.

Edit2: If vaccines are prohibitively expensive and can't be obtained for free, this system is pretty shit for poor families. In my area you can get free vaccines in certain conditions, which are very lenient. If this isn't true everywhere in the US (and it almost certainly  isn't), it should be before vaccines are made mandatory.

91,CMV: The stock market is a scam and only serves to make rich people richer by stealing from the labors of the working class,TRUE,1,t3_3i9skp,"Full disclosure: my BS is in engineering, not economics, and I'm an avowed socialist. Anyway, it seems to me that the stock market exists solely to perpetuate the accumulation of wealth at the top by people who do nothing of value. It seems immoral to me that people who don't work can make money by assigning imaginary value to the work that other people do and profiting on speculating about that work that they don't do. When their speculation gets especially irresponsible because of completely unchecked greed the economy collapses and the working class is left holding the bag, while the truly, fantastically rich laugh all the way to the bank. Can anyone explain to me why something like the stock market has to exist, or what benefit it is to the working class? I'm willing to do the reading if someone can point me in the right direction.

521,"CMV: Racism doesn't exist, it has to do with a difference in cultures and it's not worth getting rid of",FALSE,0,t3_3epz2f,"I'd like to start off by summarizing my view first:

Racism is the ""easy way"" of distinguishing between cultures, which is what actually bothers human beings and makes them be racist. There is no scientific evidence whatsoever that shows humans are capable of being racist due to skin color. It's just a generalization we have made to make the issue easier to define and by doing so we're making it harder to actually ever get rid of racism. However, to get rid of racism, we have to blend our cultures too much and I personally feel that the positives don't outweigh the negatives, because I'd rather have humans continue to be diverse.

So now let's get a little more descriptive on why I think this way. I think a good place to start is slavery. This occurred mainly because it was something that was done by Africans. They sold prisoners off and there was a demand for nearly-free labor. It didn't matter that these people were black. It was just where the slaves happened to come from, and throughout the years, the way the system worked, it just became synonymous to black people being inferior because it was easier to generalize it that way.

Then let's go to Nazi Germany. I feel like this a better example, because Jewish people have a sense of strong culture and stuck together. This helped them do better than others during the depression and they also easily became the scapegoat by having a different culture and kind of being the ""weird kids"" that never integrated properly into society. This still occurs in a lot of neighborhoods, where Jewish people like living in communities together. For example, there are Jewish neighborhoods in Toronto and New York. And of course, there's an entire country. 

This is where we get into the general picture. Each country has their own culture and that's why they're different countries. The laws, the people, and the past all make up this culture. Even within a country there will be different groups of people who were either forced to be segregated or segregated themselves to preserve their culture. This difference in culture or fear of other cultures that we do not understand is the core of racism. There's no such thing as racism and most people who do not fall into the bandwagon of associating an entire race with generalizations aren't ""racist"" but people can and should have different cultures and even frown upon certain negative aspects of other people's cultures.

By mixing all cultures, we can effectively get rid of racism. If everyone's the ""same"" then there's nothing too different that would put you off from an entire ""race"" of people that are similar in some way. However, this is not worth it, in my opinion, because having different cultures is what makes people and the world interesting.

929,CMV:The things science cannot explain is not a reasonable place to put God.,FALSE,0,t3_3b62cd,"I am a former catholic and no longer believe in God. The argument I hear for proof of god is mainly in the things science can't explain. Something couldn't have come from nothing, dark matter, intelligent design, etc. This is nonsensical.



You are essentially issuing in the same behavior ancient civilizations did. They could not understand at the time the weather, the sun, the cosmos, etc so it had to be God. All of the scriptures are written by people who had no such knowledge of the things They claimed to be God, and their lack of knowledge bleeds through as science unlocks more and more.




Now this is not to say God exists or does not exist. This is not my debate but my debate is where people are putting God. I think it quite possible to believe in God and also believe that science will shed light on the places it is the dark. Hence this post. To me is not reasonable in a world where people don't believe in God,or who believe in a different God, that putting on a label on the unexplainable is God. It is logical to put your faith, so to speak, in that science will explain these things in time, and that your belief in God belongs else where.



Now I also want to clarify to do the the things my debate touches on is not wrong, or immoral, it is simply unreasonable, not logical. I know there are many things that can give credence to your personal experiences and the deep thing inside most people there is more to this world than us. And that the proof of God is not a thing that can be measured in scientific terms. But I disagree that the universe, or multiverse, and all it's contents cannot be explained by science, and it's not logical to put god here. Change my views

I'm not saying hillary isn't going to be the next president. I'm simply saying we deserve more options and a better debate about the future of the national democratic party and country. 

I know Sanders is a very serious candidate. I also think he lacks the profile to compete with Hillary's name recognition and public achievements. kerry and biden do and have many progressive victories. Who knows if they'd catch fire with primary voters but i think they'd have a real shot. 

Last weekend until today are instructive for why need more serious contenders. O'Malley and Sanders were interupted by #blacklivesmatter activists. They both stumbled through awkward answers but they took serious stands and responded quickly. Hillary took a few days to make statement. But today, within hours of reports on problems with her email server her campaign is quick action explaining their side. 

On obvious stuff, and when she's attacked, she is immidiately responsive. When it comes to issues that are more nuanced, emotional and topical, she is late and calculated. 

The dems deserve a real challange to the hillary out of mere respect for the people who's vote they depend on. kerry or biden are that challenge.

718,"CMV: You can't compare Serena Williams to Roger Federer, Nadal, and Djokovic",FALSE,0,t3_3d16rs,"*Note I'm not anti-women or online troll

I'm sorry, but male and female sports athletes can't be compared.

Any of the top 50-150 male ATP players would beat her 9.5 out of 10 times, there are huge differences in the sport.

1. The average serve for at the 2015 Wimbledon Finals for a Female(I saw the stat during a Semi-Final game) was 94MPH while the males was 124MPH. That's a huge difference, the fastest ever female serve was 131 while the males fastest serve was 163MPH, Cilic, Groth, Karlovic, Raonic, and Roddick all of those players average first serve is above [124MPH](http://heavytopspin.com/2011/10/13/us-open-serve-speed-by-player/).

2. Females play best to 2 sets and men play best to 3 sets

3. It was tested in Battle of the sexes tennis game where Bobby Riggs(Former number 1) at age 55 played 30 year old Margrett Court(Ranked 1 at the time) and she lost in straight sets. Note he latter played King age 26 who beat him at age 56,(He couldn't get any drop shots, but still forced a 3rd set.)

4. Serrnia said in 1998 at the age of 16 that she could beat and male under 200, Karsten Braash responded ranked 203 that he would play her, and she accepted and lost (6,1 6,1)(Note: She won the US open in 1999). Venus then challenged him and lost (6,2)(6,2).

Baraash said he played like a 600th ranked player to keep the game fun.


Also the whole Female World Cup players should be paid the same is total BS in my opinion for two reasons

1. The Female World Cup was projected to bring in 26M viewers while the Male World Cup brought in 800M-1B people(Note: That some countries don't have good reporting standards so the numbers are off.)

2. The Female World Cup brought in $40M Ad revenue while the 2015 male World Cup brought in $4B which is 100x more and thats why the Mens side is paid more.

In my opinion its insulting to women to pay them the same as the male tournament if they didn't earn it.

If they want the same tournament winnings they should be advocating for a single tournament not two different tournaments. The same with Tennis if you want to compare Serrna to the male version you should be pushing for a single tournament.

By the above definition, we can be sure that there is a 'Normal' human being. Or at the very least, various 'Normal' states to make up a 'Normal' human being.

Anything that is in the majority is a 'Normal' state. So, the 'Normal' human being is a Cisgendered, Heterosexual, Chinese man.

This means that states such as Transgender, Homosexual, Autistic etc. are not 'Normal'. They are in fact 'different'. and we desperately need to stop acting as if they are normal. They are different.

602,CMV: I think that individuals who identify as transgender have an underlying mental illness that should be worked through in therapy rather than corrected by invasive medical procedures.,FALSE,0,t3_3e532y,"I'm going to try to attack this issue from multiple angles and I want to preface by saying that I am NOT trying in any way to attack the transgender community. 




-First off, I want to begin by discussing the very premise of labeling oneself as trans. I have an issue with transgender people saying that they are born with a [gendered] brain in a [wrong gendered] body. For many years women have been fighting for equality with men and in this light it is abhorrent to say that men and women have brains that are different. Feminists (both men and women) have fought hard to erase the entrenched beliefs of a patriarchal society. For example, to be a male yet be interested in feminine things and FEEL feminine is only upholding the belief that there are certain traits unique to and can only be possessed by females. This is the premise to my argument so bear with me. 



Alas, as stated above, I believe that being transgender can be one's own way (subconsciously) to mentally rebel against society's very deep and entrenched gender roles. 



-Secondly, I see thoughts of transgender individuals to be patterned similarly to the thoughts of individuals with the mental illness known as body dysmorphic disorder. Persons with BDD tend to have an obsession with a certain part of their body or facet of their personality that they blow out of proportion to reality. This obsession causes sufferers a great deal of emotional pain and can lead them to take extreme measures to remedy the perceived problem. Most people with BDD are adolescents. 

For example, someone with BDD may be so obsessed with the shape of their nose that they seek surgery to reduce their concern and obsession. However, surgery is not a treatment for BDD. BDD is a manifestation of extreme anxiety and depression and fixing the obsession does not remove said mental illnesses from the person. Most individuals who do go to extreme measures as such tend to continue experience the anxiety and depression that manifested itself as an obsession with the shape of their nose.


-Now, in that vein how are we to say that the plight of transgender people is any different? Feelings of extreme anxiety and depression directed at the person's gender, correction of gender and not a lot of resolution with the underlying mental illness.


See this study: [Long-Term Follow-Up of Transsexual Persons Undergoing Sex Reassignment Surgery: Cohort Study in Sweden.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3043071/) Research has shown that ""Persons with transsexualism, after sex reassignment, have considerably higher risks for mortality, suicidal behaviour, and psychiatric morbidity than the general population. Our findings suggest that sex reassignment, although alleviating gender dysphoria, may not suffice as treatment for transsexualism, and should inspire improved psychiatric and somatic care after sex reassignment for this patient group."" 




This is my case. Please change my view.

361,CMV: Communism is very inegalitarian.,FALSE,0,t3_3fwi59,"I shall start with an axiom, i thing what really makes the biggest difference between humans is : Physical attractiveness, money/social statuts, personal characteristics (the third is very tricky because sometimes it's interconnected with the two first : Example an intelliget person may make more money, attractive people are judged more intelligent. I think physical attractiveness is the most important but this is a personnal opinion that i won't add to the axiom).

So, IF WE accept that axiom, won't the fact of making everybody equal on economical grounds (even if it was a realistic goal, free of any abuses of those power), gives the attractive a very big edge ? Bigger than what they have now.

At least now, a man can compete against a more attractive peer in some circonstances by making more money, having a better status. That possibility would be gone in a perfect communist system. At least there is a chance of making money, it can be a really remote chance depending on the circonstances, but it's possible. Becoming attractive in the other hand.

The only way to make communism more egalitarian is to tax people more for physical attractiveness.

If you don't accept the axiom, you can also try to change my view.

636,CMV: Esports shouldn't be called sports,TRUE,1,t3_3dquqv,"I want to start by quoting the oxford dictionary's definition of sport.

""An activity involving physical exertion and skill in which an individual or team competes against another or others for entertainment""

see what esports lack? Physical exertion.

An argument I see being used commonly is ""But poker and chess are also considered sports""
I'd like to refer again to the Oxford dictionary, poker and chess lack physical exertion. So like some have already argued, chess and poker aren't real sports, I'd like to prefer to them as professional hobbies or thinking sports.

And if you try to argue that esports are real sports because they have tournaments and are regulated, then I want to argue that monopoly is a sport, there is an [official monopoly championship](http://monopoly-championship-history.wikia.com/wiki/2015_World_Championship) too.

edit: I was inspired by [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYlpxFWXCM8) video, where it is clear people still think esports should be considered a sport, just like football or something.

edit 2: wow I noticed something very immature, people down voting all my arguments, I thought one of the main rules of reddit was that down voting isn't for expressing you disagree

1443,"CMV: In a capitalist society, it is completely reasonable for men to make more money than women.",TRUE,1,t3_3633hr,"This is naturally an incredibly controversial topic and I highly doubt that many people will agree with me, but I feel compelled to discuss this. 

This needs to be prefaced by saying that all of this is based on averages, not individuals. I'm sure many women are more capable than many men, what I'm saying is that the general trend across the board is that on average a male worker is more productive. 

Men work almost triple the amount of overtime hours than women.

Men work more standard hours than women.

Women take more sick days off work than men.

Women are more likely than men to take several years of maternity leave off of work.

A small percentage of women undergo severe PMS and consequently work at a diminished capacity for several days of each month.

To use anecdotal evidence, yesterday i came in to work, to find that all 8 garbages were completely filled. This was strange, since the closing crew is supposed to take out the garbages every night. I asked my coworker why no one had done the garbages last night, and I was effectively told that only girls were working the closing shift, and none of them wanted to touch the garbages because they thought it was gross. So I had to take out 8 garbages first thing in the morning, because I was a man. Additionally, the parking lot was overflowing with trash that had spilled out of the over-packed garbage cans, but none of the girls had done the usual nightly responsibility of sweeping, since they thought it was a man's job as well. I'm not talking about one or two co-workers here, there were 7 women on shift, and every single one of them followed this gender stereotyped idea of what closing responsibilities they should have. Its one thing if men and women divide tasks based on relative strengths and weaknesses, but if someone neglects to do a task because there's no one of the opposite sex to assign it to, that is ridiculous. When only men are closing, someone still ends up washing the dishes and shining the countertops. 


Due to the biological, sociological, and psychological factors that women face, they are on average less suited to performing excessive labour, and in an economic system where more work = more money, it is no surprise that men make more than women. 

What I find most surprising is that when I bring up this issue, I am met with incredible opposition, as if I am trying to oppress women or promote sexism. The truth is, an entire branch of feminism exists for the very reasons I have stated; socialist feminism believes that men have a higher capacity to work and are therefore at an advantage in a capitalist society. They believe the only way wage equality can happen is through instating socialist policies that ensure employers are forced to pay men and women equally. 

I am not saying that women *deserve* to be paid less because they have children for example, humanity needs new people to be born , and as such women should not be penalized for taking time off work to raise children. However, we do not live in a moral democracy. We live in a capitalist democracy, where employers are free to pay their employees whatever they think is proportional to the revenue or work that each specific employee will bring to the company. On average, certainly not always, but on average, men can generate slightly more work and revenue than women. 

Thus, the only way women can achieve equal pay is through socialist change in legislation. ",1443,FALSE,,FALSE,0
1138,CMV: I don't think a communist society could work,FALSE,0,t3_39bh92,"I'd first like to say that I am not experienced in this topic, so I apologize if I offend anybody's ideology. 

A communist society requires, if I recall correctly from my conversation with my Marxist friends, that means of production are in the hand of the workers and that no propriety is private. All service being public and everyone being paid the same wage with heavy income tax.Which would eventually leading to the abolition of wage/money.

The problem I see with this is that without  money a communist society would lose it's ability to do business with other countries, bartering not being a stable enough way of obtaining goods. The only way I see it working out is if the whole  or very substantial percentage of the planet became communist and hence incorporated in a greater system or having a closed economy which no country has.Now the big problem, I have with that is that contrarily to our current system which has varying degrees of privatization and interventionism, communism leaves little place for those variations, it is unlikely that every country on this planet will adopt the same exact political system (due to there different situations both cultural and economic). I don't even think there has been a point in human society where that happened.

Also, there is the pretty common argument of lack of incentive.Money is a tool that insures regularity, you regularly get paid and with that pay you can seek out things that stimulate and please you or that you need for your health and safety.Without it the motivator that seems to remain is love for one's craft or love for the collective which are much less stable and prone to decrease time goes on for most people. It may seem like I am digressing, but your nervous system (including your pleasure centers) is made so that once you face a stimuli enough times in the same way , you develop a level of habituation. For example, once you've had your shirt on all day, you no longer feel it unless information relating to it is pointed, once you do a certain activity that brought you pleasure each day your nervous system no longer releases dopamine (making you feel pleasure) and have to modify it to get the same high (think of an addict taking a larger intake or a food/porn addict who develops more eclectic tastes relating to his/her addiction). In short, banking on peoples love for their jobs seems to be risky as those people would eventually no longer be as stimulated doing their job and without any need of wage they would be free to quit, not get a job or lower their assiduity.

80,CMV: Day drinking is optimal.,FALSE,0,t3_3ifct2,"I will preface by saying, I am referring to the benefits of being drunk in itself. Being drunk generally feels good. However, alcohol consumption to the point of feeling drunk has negative health effects. 

Getting drunk at night, assuming a normal sleep schedule, typically entails falling asleep while drunk. Yet...Your body is still experiencing the negative effects of alcohol while you sleep through the benefits of being drunk. You are incurring the cost of being drunk, while not realizing the benefits. In addition and based on my personal experience, falling asleep while drunk does not lead to waking up well rested.

The obvious arguments against this will be with regards to social life. I completely agree that if getting drunk with your friends gives you additional utility, by all means drink at night. However, if you are simply looking for that strong buzz now and again...Day drinking is the way to go.

53,CMV:The widespread belief of religion is a sign of human weakness,TRUE,1,t3_3injsb,"This is not meant as a disrespect to most organized religions, merely an observation i have come to.

The widespread belief or following of most organized religions (Christianity, Islam, Judaism) is a sign of human weakness in a couple of ways. 

The need for an afterlife in most religions satisfies our general fears of death, and the impermanence and futility of our lives. The theory isn't backed by much scientific evidence as far as i know, so the reason to believe in an afterlife isn't that it makes more sense but that it makes life easier. A fear of death and impermanence so strong that one must believe in something that i would categorize as fairytale. This is what i would call a weakness. 

The need for moral guidance in life - to need guidance from religion to know the difference between right and wrong is also a sign of weakness in that it shows a lack of judgement and wisdom for one to decide for themselves what is right or wrong. Furthermore, the need of a consequence by eternal damnation as persuasion not to do ""bad things"", and the need of an incentive by eternal salvation to do good. Is a sign of weakness in that it shows that human-nature is bad, or barbaric in a sense.


EDIT: Keep the comments coming guys - ""i'll secede on that point - ""moral guidance"" is not evidence for human weakness. But a motivation to believe in a creator.""

494,"CMV: ""Offense is taken, not given"" is an illegitimate argument since it can just as easily be applied to any emotion we have control over (which according to the stoics is most of them).",FALSE,0,t3_3euv6y,"I see memes and statements all the time around the idea that ""offense is taken not given"". Usually in the context of someone protesting that something is offensive, and people poking fun at them for the unreasonableness of the offense they took.

But while I would agree it is possible to behave as if something is far more offensive than most reasonable people would agree it is, this is a qualitatively different issue than ""offense is given not taken"".

Stoicism is the ancient philosophy that pain and suffering can be made far more endurable by your reaction to it; specifically, deliberate indifference shields you from suffering. The stoic solution to pain and misfortune is to refuse to let it dominate you and therefore reduce its ultimate harm.

Similar ideas of detaching yourself from suffering or seeking value in painful experiences can be found in Buddhism and Existentialism. Viktor Frankl, holocaust survivor, wrote *Man's Search for Meaning* about how focusing on the positive and meaningful aspects of life in the midst of a horrible experience helped him and other's survive and rebuild their lives.

So I agree with the notion that someone can stoically endure offensive behavior, and I'd even agree with the idea that this is, for the individual, the least mentally stressful or distracting way of dealing with these experience. This doesn't necessarily mean complete internalization - passivity is not the same as stoicism.

The problem I have is with anyone asserting that because offense is 'taken and no given', bad behavior should not be called out, or should be suffered silently. Words and actions *can* betray sordid underlying attitudes. They can make people feel unwelcome. Saying that people should silently tolerate this emotional harm from offensive remarks because they control their own attitudes is like saying people should silently tolerate any harm or injustice, simply because they can (according to stoicism).

Let's step back to the specific case of the 'unreasonably sensitive'.

If you are drunk and shove someone, we'd probably agree that it's a bit hysterical and even unreasonable for that person to sue you for assault. But you are still in the wrong; you've done something wrong and you could have saved yourself the trouble by not shoving them.

And if that person had a bizarre medical condition where his skull was eggshell thing and he fell over and shattered his skull, then you'd *definitely* be liable, and 'he shouldn't have been out in a bar, where people shove people' or 'he should have worn a football helmet' or 'he should have kept his balance' or 'he should endure his serious skull injury without suffering because of the existential meaninglessness of all our lives which forces us to find meaning subjectively' are all horrible excuses that won't and shouldn't help you in court!

If you bumped into this man by accident with the same result, you'd not be a criminal, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't try to watch where you're going and not accidentally knock them over.

The same goes for emotional harm. Some people really are emotionally fragile and some aren't themselves but like to advocate for those who are. And maybe like the thin-skulled man shouldn't become a boxer there are some decisions the emotionally fragile should make carefully, but that doesn't mean you should go around shoving people and insulting those who call you out.

**TL;DR** To change my view, convince me that there is something substantially differentiating offense from other types of harm and suffering that justifies ""offense is taken not given"" as a reaction to those saying a thing is offensive, rather than defense of the thing itself. Or attack from another angle you think of.",494,FALSE,,TRUE,1
616,CMV: I'm a closet sexist serving as a senior executive in a male-dominated industry that has the ability to inflict positive change onto the lives of quite a few women.,FALSE,0,t3_3dzg3o,"Revulsion. Disgust. Anger. Resentment. Spitefulness. 

Most humans would associate these responses alongside mass displays of torture or killing. Perhaps such a countenance would be most appropriately donned whilst becoming informed of the latest school shooting. There are many permissible circumstances in which one would be justified to feel such repulsion. 

This is what I feel when discussing women's issues. 

Throughout my young adult life, I have always sought out knowledge which furthered the distance between my personal beliefs and my upbringing. As a son of a son of a sharecropper from southern Mississippi, I was raised with fundamentalist Christian, neo-conservative paradigms.
Yet, for some reason, while the aforementioned constructs were so easily eliminated from my reality... Even the flurry of knowledge and humanity which spurned such personal renaissance was futile in this regard as I have trouble even acknowledging the women's rights movements as anything more meaningful than tabloid journalism. 

If I were to be 100% honest, I can honestly say that I've never seen racism in the corporate world. Yet sexism does abound. I work in Network Security, one of the most male-dominated fields known to exist within corporate boundaries. Many women have spoken out about this, but I can confirm it is similar in experience to the way [this blogger has put it] (http://www.themakersofthings.com/2010/03/melissa-hathaway-internet-security.html). 
I have worked under superiors who have outright stated their unwillingness to employ females, especially on male-dominated teams. I have seen a group of men conspire against a female counterpart in pursuit of righting perceived wrongs. 

In my few short attempts to annihilate this final bastion of uneducated ignorance, (which, admittedly, has been expressed and interpreted as sexism) I have failed miserably. When the fallacies which seem to form the battle-cry for many associated with feminist movements ([70% Statistic](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/christina-hoff-sommers/wage-gap_b_2073804.html) and the [biological implications of gender] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hjernevask)) are seemingly ignored, it is very hard to empathize.

But today I received the inspiration behind this urgent desire for comprehension: 

I was offered the position of a lifetime on the basis that the only other candidate in serious consideration, a female, wouldn't be quite capable of dealing with the ""stresses of the environment"". That was the official response I was given by my new supervisor... But while I've only been with the company for 6 months, she has been in her position for 4 years. Same department. No movement. 

The guys make fun of her constantly. She makes it easy.
We use a chatroom/voting app online to determine where we go to lunch everyday. I was invited to it the first day of my employment, when I was treated to lunch. She discovered it about a month ago, when I spilled the beans by accident. 
When the guys at lunch found out, they told me she would ""ruin the fun"" and joked that there ""isn't a way to value an account as .7 a vote"". 

I laughed at the jokes and agreed with the remarks. This is my comfort zone. 

But when she handed in her resignation this morning upon hearing the decision, I couldn't help but feel a little bit guilty. 

For her coworkers, who viewed her as an unforgiving political stalwart, it was a victory. For her boss, who she had reported to HR twice for sexual harassment/discrimination, it was a monumental occasion. 

""(He) had been trying to figure out how to fire her since (he) had been hired."" he expounded at lunch today. 

But when I stopped by her office this morning and saw the trash bin full of Kleenex alongside the two workplace 'awards' she had been given... it was difficult. Her eyes spelled defeat... deep. Not the kind that you come back from. The kind that comes from a life of perceived failure.  

The group voted to go to a wings bar and drink in celebration. I was toasted as the ""man who killed the witch."" I smiled, but for the first time in my life I am feeling as though I must begin to confront my denial and willful ignorance. 

Thus, I am here. Not completely by my own conscious will, but instead driven by a subconscious desire and need for justice. While I can't make things right at work, I am in a position now of senior executive leadership, the youngest to don such a title in the history of the firm. I sit at the head of a department of one of the largest financial firms in the country. I can start making a difference.

The problem I have is that I don't believe you. Even with the abhorrent anecdotal experiences I could cite, I haven't seen a shred of empirical evidence which shows this is anything outside of a few small circles. In fact, I can easily rationalize away my experiences with only a slight bit of denial.

But that would be easy. I already won a position I shouldn't have had the easy way. While I *despise* winning that way, business is business and the world keeps spinning. What I don't wish to do, however, is conduct myself in a manner in which I disadvantage my female counterparts, be they potential employees or individuals I encounter throughout my career. But I fear that my personal beliefs have a large potential for negating those altruistic ideals. 

When Ellen Pao resigned from the firm, it was apparent to everyone with connections inside the industry that she was scapegoated. It was so well-known that publishers have been forced [to address this directly.] (http://www.forbes.com/sites/ellenhuet/2015/07/13/who-fired-reddits-victoria-taylor-yishan-wong-alexis-ohanian-ellen-pao/)

I fit the median demographic for Reddit dead-center. I despised Pao. I degrade feminists. I am sexist, but consider myself left-leaning.

I am ready to change that. But everywhere I look, on every feminist site, I only see whining and complaining. No studies. No empirical evidence. Just feel-good baby food seemingly written for an emotional, illogical audience. This is how I view women's rights activists. 

Help me change. Please...

1268,CMV: Sexual intercourse should only be shared between two people already intimately acquainted,FALSE,0,t3_37vt4d,"I just had an orgasm. I realized in that brief half minute or so, I was stripped of all inhibition, showing what could only be described as my rawest, most human self. It struck me that experiencing that moment, in either the first or secondhand, is a very personal experience and something valuable enough that I would not want to share it with anyone that I did not already trust and love. This is the basis for my view.

I realize that not everyone feels and interprets an orgasm the same way. The experience is still as important to me as it was my first time, due to essentially maintaining its value. I've only had intercourse with people already very close and dear. As such, I'm able to feel fully myself in those times and share intimate moments that, quite frankly, I can't see myself having with someone I met 4 hours beforehand.

I'm making the assumption that sex with the recently acquainted does not yield the same kind of intimacy and in fact devalues the experience. This is a cornerstone of the view and possibly where I falter?

Thanks for the thoughts. This view I hold is quickly becoming very incongruent with the view of the average 20-something and I want to get rid of it as fast as possible!

1093,"CMV: The ""Fuck Pao"" crowd has no end-game.",FALSE,0,t3_39pk4l,"A few days after the banning of /r/fatpeoplehate, the dust is beginning to settle. There are still multiple posts at the top of /r/all from subs like /r/EllenPao_IsA_Cunt and /r/gasthesnoo, but with every passing day, it's relenting.

However, many people remain steadfast in the belief that they can get Ellen Pao ousted from the CEO position. One of the top posts in /r/all right now is this: 

&gt;Hey Reddit Board Members, if Redditors can push a stupid button for 2 months straight you better believe we can keep Reddit ""unsafe"" for as long as it takes to replace Ellen Pao

I don't think those people are really thinking this through, and it will ultimately prove to be a waste of time. Board members aren't going to look at a bunch of people (most of whom are upset because their hatred of people has been censored) calling the CEO a cunt and say, ""Boy they're making a mess of things. We'd best give them what they want."" A far more likely scenario is, ""We don't want those assholes on our site anyway. Good riddance.""

I also don't think any great exodus is inbound. /r/fatpeoplehate had 150,000 subscribers.

I think at most one million people ultimately leave Reddit for Voat, and I don't think that number is nearly high enough for any of the higher ups to care.

So ultimately, I think all this outrage will prove fruitless and nothing will come of any of this. CMV.

301,"CMV: I have no moral obligation to pay for things that I can download for free, whether or not it is legal.",FALSE,0,t3_3gc9i0,"I don't often pirate stuff, I have not pirated any games in the past eight years or so and only pirate movies that I have no convenient way to see (i.e. are not available anywhere for digital purchase or rental for a reasonable price). I rarely pirate music, and only pirate music when I cannot find a legal streaming source, so I can't try the artist or tracks before buying them.

However I only do these things because I feel compelled to by the quality of the product, not because of any moral obligation. I actually feel zero moral obligation to not jusst pirate anything. I choose not to because I feel like paying for them.

I believe that I do not have any moral obligation to pay for things I can digitally pirate because, in short, there is no difference between me paying $60 for a game to an online store or paying $0 to a seeder to torrent it. Both ""sellers"" have the game and are offering to give it to me for different prices. That is my transaction and that is my involvement with the product; if a studio's employees starve because many people didn't pay for the game, that's really not anyone else's issue because I'm not the one who commissioned this game, the game was made whether or not I inteded to purchase it, and the onus of figuring out how to pay their employees falls upon the people responsible for the creation of the game, not me. If more games won't be made like this due to piracy, that's irrelevant because I'm not morally obligated to enable the developer to continue making games. Ultimately, the result for the developer is the same; either I don't play the game at all and they get zero dollars, or I play the game without their permission and they get zero dollars. In either case, I have not removed anything from them or taken anything physical away from them. I have merely gained something, and the costs have been generously footed by the seeders.

The only exception is if I *did* have some hand in ""commissioning"" the project; for example, if I took part in a kickstarter. That means I'm essentially asking them to make the game for me and then it means that I'm responsible for them getting payment from me.

But Unless I asked them to make the game, I have no responsiility to pay for it.

786,CMV: If you are unable to make above 40k/year you are not very intelligent.,FALSE,0,t3_3cfyk2,"My reasoning is that having under 40k sucks, it's managable, but it is a struggle.  I understand 'intelligence' is a very murky word and everyone thinks they are intelligent, but in the general 'competency of life' sense of the word, if you are unable to hold down a good enough job that money is an ever present problem in your life, I question your intelligence.

Now would be a good time to exclude a few groups:

- Those who have a low income now, but are pretty confident in their ability to hit that threshold in a few years (think grad student).

- Very handy(?might not be the right word?) people, (I have a friend whose dad built an extension on his house, that's as good as money.)

- Those who could easily make a decent salary, but conciously decided that their life would be better if they made a lot less money (I have a friend that chose to work for a non-profit after receiving an engineering offer)

- EDIT: I don't think this counts as changing my view, but after the first wave a responses, I think it's fair to add that anyone with a physical disability through no fault of their own is another exception to this list.

Obviously adjust the arbitrary 40k number regionally.

I don't mean to kick you while you're down, I'm hoping someone changes my views because this is my natural inclination and I'm sure I've made a fault somewhere (or two).  This is literally the only sub on reddit that I could share something like this.  

So there you have it, feel free to change my view.

1221,CMV: We should be deregulating everything for the same reasons we are deregulating Marijuana.,FALSE,0,t3_38dr50,"Some of the strongest arguments we, as consumers in a market, make for deregulating the sales of marijuana can be morally, and empirically applied to nearly any facet of the market the government currently regulates.

I'm open to real evidence pointing to alternatives, but as far as history would have it, regulation on a consumer good usually is bad for the people the market serves. The negative repercussions vary widely in scope, but are almost always worse than the alternatives to deregulation. 

An easy example is tobacco. A cash crop like weed, and the same basic stigmas attached to it. I understand the scientific discussion about the toxicity of both, but why not let the market drive the success or failure of the products based on their perceived dangers and benefits? And if pot is safer, couldn't it be a safer and more sought alternative than tobacco? Isn't this more effective than simply regulating tobacco? The most common argument for legalizing pot I see is that we should be able to choose our own safety for our own bodies.

Well, why not live by this logic? What about regulating airbags in cars? Shouldn't there be alternative choices for my own personal reasons? 

Same with the practice of medicine. Why does the AMA decide an adequate doctor? Shouldn't I have as more say in a doctor's value than a license board?

I've truly yet to hear logical arguments against this, other than emotional appeals. I'm open to good insight into these topics!

EDIT: I am not confusing decriminalization with deregulation. They are one and the same to me, and part of what I would like the discussion to revolve around.

987,"CMV: I don't believe that the current strategy of guilting and disparaging white people as a general collective whole is constructive towards correcting race relations, and I believe it is doing far more harm than good by turning away potential allies.",FALSE,0,t3_3an18h,"Every time I read the news or social media, and especially the comments tied to said news or social media, I end up with this cognitive dissonance.

On one hand: I understand and accept the privileges set forth to me, as a US American white male, that many members of minority groups do not have available to them. Even things as simple as watching movies and realized I'm seeing an exponentially larger number of white males than any other group, can remind me that there are things in my life that I take for granted which do not exist, or at least are there to a much smaller degree, in the lives of others. I find this unacceptable; I despise the idea that people are born into set roles or classes due to things outside of their control. No one asks to be born into poverty, or born to be viewed as suspicious just because they take part in activities others can do without question or second looks. 

On the other hand: Every day that I open the news, I find a new article that implies that I am some kind of horrible, racist, monster based only on my gender or the color of my skin. Sites like Salon, Motherjones, and Huffington Post drop hundreds of articles each month about white people AS A GENERALIZED GROUP, as if we're all some sort of problem people, individually. Even college professors like Saida Grundy seem to have no problem saying this... and their Universities have no problem allowing it. Which is part of what bothers me the most... it's not that clickbait articles exist, but rather that NO ONE CARES. 

**[EDIT: Edited the example to show a better case for point. Previous link was to the works of Arthur Chu. This is more inclusive]**
Example:  Take this selection of posts: http://www.salon.com/topic/whats_the_matter_with_white_people/ On this list, replace the word ""White"" with ""Black"" in your head. Look at how horrendously racist that list now comes out to be. And yet, because it says ""White"", it's cool. All is well in the world. Articles that start with ""Kanye West vs. white mediocrity: "" are currently in style.

Well, the problem is that it takes people like me, who WANT to be an ally and WANT to stand up and add another voice to the fray, shouting that things should be better for people who are not white... and it makes me want to remain silent. What could compel me to self loathe to the point of standing beside racists who despise me for the color of my skin, who disparage me for nothing that I did but rather the actions of people unrelated to me that I have never met and only share the single point of connection in the melonin content of our skin? 

What's the point of trying, if I'm a monster because of how I look and the only way I can ""correct"" that is to disparage myself because of the actions of others? Even just making a post like this, pointing out how digustingly bigotted and racist these views are, will make ME out to be the racist for bringing it up.

I truly do not understand the current path we are taking in race relations. I do not understand how this is supposed to help. I see so many people saying that we need to tackle racism head on, and that we need to talk about the problems... this is me doing that. Even if I get called a racist or a bigot for it, that's ok. I'm talking about the problem, and it IS a problem.

Why good does alienating allies really accomplish?

EDIT: Deltas have been awarded. Excellent points were made, and I while I still feel some injustice in certain situations on this topic, I do not feel that it is quite the widespread issue I viewed it as when I began. I still feel that the media is causing undue defensiveness with their ""click-bait"" article titles... but otherwise I feel better about the situation.

**EDIT** -  My first gold! Thanks :)

1325,CMV: I think FIFA should keep the 2022 World Cup in Qatar,FALSE,0,t3_377t3z,"I don't see that much wrong with it. It is promoting tourism to the middle east and raises awareness for the developing country of Qatar, much like South Africa did. As well, it gives the Qatar National Team a chance to compete in the World Cup. I feel economically it is beneficial for both Fifa and Qatar. 2022 is a long way from now, and Qatar has promised that it would be able to fix the problem with heat using a stadium wide cooling system. 

I'm also excited to see all the modern technology that will be implemented into this World Cup. Also, I feel it would be a waste of money and time if the World Cup was moved somewhere else. Construction has already started and countries have already moved on to preparing bids for another World Cup. A sudden change of location could be disastrous for certain countries. 

Finally, in the end, we go to and watch the World Cup because football is football. There should be more time spent focusing on the emergence of stars in the World Cup, how teams can adapt to weather, how today's young stars will play in their prime.

1293,"CMV: People who are ""saved"" by suicide hotlines aren't legitimately suicidal; they just have poor crisis management.",TRUE,1,t3_37nl1w,"Edit: To clarify, I don't mean to say that the type of people with poor crisis management aren't at risk for killing themselves; by ""legitimacy"" I'm talking about how valid the wish to die is in the first place. I also don't think that crisis hotlines are unnecessary or should be eliminated, because they very obviously help people. Those who are legitimately suicidal as I'm defining it in this post are those who actually want to die, and have a rational reason for doing so, rather than simply acting on impulse or using death as an escape from an acutely stressful situation. The duration of time that someone has a suicidal with isn't necessarily indicative of whether their wish to die is legitimate or not, but I think that having time to consider a decision and its alternatives generally helps with rationality. I also don't intend to claim that depression is a necessity for being suicidal or ""legitimately suicidal,"" although I'm sure it increases the likelihood of being so.

Also, downvotes don't change views, people. 

***

I've suffered from very severe depression for most of my life, and have considered suicide quite frequently. One of the things people like to throw out is contact information to suicide hotlines, but they've never been helpful to me.

My personal experience aside, I really don't see how these crisis hotlines could help someone who legitimately wants to die (as opposed to someone who uses suicide or self-harm as an escape from acutely painful emotions or a stressful situation). If you were set on dying, then why would you want to call a hotline like that in the first place? I think that if someone wanted to die, they wouldn't commit suicide on an impulse in a moment of crisis; they would do research and try to carry out suicide in the most effective way possible with the least chance of error. Calling a hotline is also not going to change any of the external factors that would lead up to someone being suicidal. Perhaps they would help the person consider their issues in a different light, but again I think that's evidence of poor stress management.

I can't make any statements to whether or not my personal suicidal wishes are ""legitimate"" or not because there is always the looming possibility that my mental illness is clouding my judgement to some extent, but I think that it's theoretically possible that someone would want to die on a rational basis. I also don't think that suicide hotlines are generally helpful for the chronically depressed, but that's only tangential to my main argument. Once you're mentally ill for a long period of time, (I think the issue of mental illness and consent become very clouded, if for no other reason than it's impractical to deny someone consent for the majority of their lives because of a mental health condition.) It seems like the wish to die in and of itself is a basis to claim that someone is not acting in their right state of mind, which I think is illogical and unfortunate. 

I know this paragraph was written somewhat messily, and I apologize for that. I'm just trying to provide some context for my view. I will be happy to clarify anything for anyone that asks.

902,CMV: Bill Nye is not a real scientist in any meaningful way to the public.,TRUE,1,t3_3bf41n,"I submit that Nye's public perception of 'being a scientist' is largely overblown by childhood memories. In his history, he had one 'scientific' accolade: he developed a device for Boeing years before he was every famous. Beyond that, he's just been a guy on TV reading from a script.

Even working at Boeing, his primary job was that of a TV persona: he made the training videos. 

I feel that Obama's use of Nye regarding global warming is strictly an appeal to the populace who grew up watching a kid show, not the opinion of a professional with a background in anything remotely related to climate. This doesn't mean I disagree with what he said, but only disagree with the idea that he should be trusted 'as a scientist'. He's a PR tool in that regard. He only parrots others' research - in everything he's done -not anything he actually observed through his own research. 

Further, simply having a degree in a scientific background makes you aware of that background (he has a bachelor's in *engineering* from Cornell), but that doesn't make you a scientist in the field. I know many people with degrees in one field who work in an entirely different field. A law degree doesn't make you a lawyer, for instance. My father has one and he's a retired contractor: never worked a legal case in his life. Nye's background hardly applies to the vast majority of his TV demonstrations and appearances.

And to the point of Carl Sagan, Neil Tyson, and others: these are actual scientists who have been published, who do(did) research in the field of their degree and beyond. Yes, these men are TV personas, but unlike Nye they're actually also scientists. 

So? Change my view. He's one of my childhood heroes too, but I simply can't accept him as a scientist. I feel that cheapens real work by real scientists.

Edit: [Delta awarded](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3bf41n/cmv_bill_nye_is_not_a_real_scientist_in_any/cslnyww), albeit not in a way I had in mind. It's technically correct, [but we all know...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hou0lU8WMgo)

To many of the comments: 

- Education is important and admirable, but that still doesn't make you a scientist in my view. If that's the standard of calling oneself a scientist while being displayed on news media as an expert to be listened to, then really, there's no measure for what an expert is in that regard.  

- There are many qualified scientists who are also good on TV: I still assert Nye's appearances were heavily caused by his association as the funny lab-coat and bow-tie 'science guy' and childhood memories, which is a manipulative and deceptive thing to do when appearing in support of public policy (regardless of my agreement and my own support of the same policy). That deception was not unintentional, but calculated. Herein lies my problem and reasoning for this post. I should note that this still stands as my view, and the delta awarded was awarded basically because I worded the post in a particular way. If anyone would like to address this view, I'd award another delta if the mods are okay with it. 

- I really, honestly think that comparing Nye and people like Neil Tyson and Carl Sagan is an insult to the latter two. That's like comparing your high school bio teacher to the same two men. That's utterly absurd in my mind: Tyson and Sagan contributed more to their fields than Nye ever could at this point. 

- Nye's only contribution I can see, which is the reason for the single delta awarded thus far, has been in the development and design of a hydraulic pressure resonance suppressor used for 747s, to this day. I concede this is a meaningful, scientific advancement for the public made by Bill Nye. ",902,TRUE,,FALSE,0
1051,CMV: Hillary Clinton is obviously the best candidate for 2016. Reddit's love affair with Sanders stems from a dislike of establishment and an unrealistic understanding of the presidency.,FALSE,0,t3_3a49yv,"While I align more so with Sanders, politically speaking, I can see that Clinton is absolutely the better choice. She's well-connected, influential, and has many allies across agencies, in the private sector, and in governments across the world as well. As president, your job is not only to be the figurehead for the movement, but the backroom dealer who makes the coalitions you need to win. Clinton may not be signaling the way I like, but I would damn sure take a centrist who can get stuff done over a socialist with little pull. 

Sanders is a great figure, but he has zero influence in the Beltway and, if he were to win, he'd be shut out of most circles of power. Politics is messy and Reddit's fascination with Sanders is a reflection of the user base's youth and black-and-white understanding of D.C. politics.

292,"CMV: I don't think the BlackLivesMatter protester should have interrupted Sanders' rally. However, it makes sense to choose Sanders as the candidate to interrupt, rather than anyone else",TRUE,1,t3_3gdtg4,"I know Sanders is probably the best candidate for BLM policies (though O'Malley is good as well), and that his supporters are probably the most likely to support BLM. This is exactly why I think he's the right choice.

First, I think it means you get less backlash against the movement in general. If she were to interrupt another candidate, more people would use that as evidence against the BlackLivesMatter movement in general. That means more people would use the incident to negatively paint the entire BLM movement since they are less familiar with it, while the Sanders supporters who would be upset would be the least likely to do this.

Second, it forces Bernie to make a bigger deal out of racial injustice in his campaign. Even if he doesn't support the people who interrupt him, he has to at least issue some statement that says ""Why'd you pick on me? Here's everything I'm doing to help . . ."" and suddenly, it's a major part of his campaign.

Sanders *does* have a solid [page on racial injustice](https://berniesanders.com/issues/racial-justice) on his site, but it is a little weak in terms of actual policy prescriptions. Compared to [O'Malley's page](https://martinomalley.com/policy/criminal-justice/), Sanders has a lot of work to do. Interestingly enough, O'Malley began to better flush out his policy on criminal just after he was interrupted by BLM protesters.

Forcing his hand in making his stances on racial justice more public and more thorough is the best way to make it a bigger campaign issue, and is the best possible result for the BLM movement at large.

It's not too hard to believe something like this might be lost - only 46 years ago millions of people *watched* the moon landing on TV, but almost no one had the technical means to have their own recording of it. Here we are now with the [original tapes missing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11_missing_tapes) - sure we have a recording, but think of how much better recordings we might have if (like today) people could have made their own high-end home recordings at least matching the quality of the original broadcast.
A very similar story can be said about the [missing Dr. Who epsiodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_missing_episodes)  - of which [some were recovered thanks to piracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_missing_episodes#Private_collectors)

993,"CMV: ""If everyone is super, no one will be,"" is not a chilling prediction; it would be a good thing, and ""The Incredibles"" was wrong to give this viewpoint to a villain.",FALSE,0,t3_3alov5,"It's been awhile since I've seen the movie, but one line has stuck with me for years: ""If everyone's super, no one will be."" This basically sums up the ideology of the villain of the film: Syndrome is trying to build inventions that would give any user superpower-level abilities, so that ""natural"" superheroes wouldn't be special anymore.

Now, Syndrome is a villain, regardless of his beliefs. He kidnaps the Incredibles and tries to kill at least some of them. He also built a death robot to destroy an entire city (for reasons that I still do not understand). The movie correctly portrays these behaviors as villainous. However, for no apparent reason, Syndrome is acting on a surprisingly positive, egalitarian motive. If they wanted to make a compelling villain, he could have had a simple world domination goal, or just wanted to make himself a superhero. But no: Syndrome's goals are to make ""natural"" superheroes no better than anyone else...by making everyone a superhero. And this is bad, because....?

The theme gets even weirder at the end, where Dash pretends to be less than stellar at track and gets second place, despite his powers. Apparently, the Incredibles are fine with the appearance of equality, as long as they know they're really superior. In fact, it's nice to let other people PRETEND to be the best, and you don't have to feel threatened by that, because you'll always be the real best. I can't help but view the film as a struggle between two profoundly incorrect viewpoints. I walk away knowing that Syndrome did more evil things, but hating the Incredibles more because they're just so unlikeable.

Syndrome is correctly cast as the villain of the piece because of his bullying of the Incredibles and city destructobot, but his plan to provide cool gadgets for everyone is not evil, and it would not be a bad thing if ""everyone was super."" On the contrary, it would be the best outcome of the movie. We only get a brief glimpse of Syndrome's inventions, but even the few we see appear to have some potential livesaving applications (flying shoes for firefighters to get people out of burning buildings; laser glasses to rescue people trapped in car accidents). If everyone was super, it wouldn't just be a lucky few tasked with saving people whether they wanted to or not. Instead, those who truly wanted to could do it, and as many people as necessary could have each ""power."" If we had the technology to do so, we ought to make everyone super. Syndrome's alleged motive for evil falls totally flat, and the Incredibles' reaction is weirdly elitist. CMV.

Edit: My V has been partially C'd. Thanks to u/FlyingMiracle for first pointing out that I misconstrued Syndrome's real goal. His stated plan was to sell his gadgets to the highest bidder, not give them to well-trained service professionals to save lives. He did SAY ""if everyone is super, no one will be"" in a threatening tone of voice, and I still think equality is a dumb motive for a villain. But it doesn't seem to BE his motive at all. He's just going to make the rich and powerful more rich and powerful, and probably destroy the world when tons of rich, inexperienced people fuck shit up with his devices. He claims to be working for equality, but even if he went about his plan without trying to kill the Incredibles or unleash his deathbot, he would still be wreaking havoc, not promoting equality.",993,TRUE,,FALSE,0

1242,"CMV: If gay and interracial marriage is legal in a state, then polygamous marriage should also be legal in that state.",FALSE,0,t3_3836eq,"A few things to note before a start:

1. I'm not arguing to the contrary against gay marriage. I am for gay marriage as I am for polygamous marriages.

2. I'm not arguing for forced marriage or arranged marriages where several women are forced to marry a single man, like in various religious sects, but the concept of a marriage containing multiple people as a whole.

3. I am as much for polyandrous marriages as I am for polygynous marriages. (i.e. women can have multiple husbands in addition to men having multiple wives.

4. Willing to discuss this *legally* and *ethically* in seperate spheres, but let's try not and mix the two together too much, unless absolutely necessary. It is assumed that gay marriage is both legal and ethical for the purpose of this discussion. If you believe gay marriage should be illegal or is unethical, then those arguments have merit towards polygamous marriage as well.

Alrighty, now onto my main points.

1. Polyamarous people deserve the same right to equality, to marry who they love, just like homosexuals, and heterosexuals. Polyamarous relationships are no less moral than homosexual relationships, and relationships between consenting adults should be able to be consummated in marriage.

2. Marriage was not made legal by a popular vote in many places. The only country to legalize it via a popular vote was Ireland a week or so ago, everywhere else had it decided by judges or representatives. In the US, interracial marriage and gay marriage has been ruled as legal by courts, not voted in. Public opinion towards polygamous marriage is irrelevant.

3. When it comes to raising children, one can assume that since having a single parent results in worse-off children, then having a higher amount of parental figures and providers would make for a similar, if not better child-rearing than having one parent, two parents, or two parents of the same sex (all of which are legal). [Source] (http://archive.news-leader.com/article/20121125/NEWS01/311250054/single-parents-Ozarks-poverty) [Source 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_House)

4. When it comes to insurance, legal proceedings, etc. everything can be easily adjusted to treating additional spouses as additional dependents (as where such institutions are adjusted for additional children). Yes, it is true that the current system does not allow for it, but it can be adjusted. When it comes to division of property, divorce, etc. things will simply be divided by the amount of people participating in the marriage, i.e. if there are three people, everything gets split 33%, or if the other two remain married, it gets split 66%. Prenuptual agreements can take care of anything that may be complicated by this if spouses have different intentions for how things are split. There will be a cap where insurance coverage/tax benefits end, i.e. if you have more than 7 children you stop receiving benefits for any more. For taxes and insurance, children are treated similarly to spouses, and additional spouses shouldn't complicate things out of reason. The specifics as to what the cap will be, how things get split, life and death decisions, etc. can be hammered out by individual states and individual people participating in a marriage, just like in other marriages.

5. Sham marriages containing two people that don't love each other, of the same or different sex are currently legal. *Chuck and Larry* marriages are currently possible, the only difference in allowing polygamous marriages would be to not allow odd numbers of people to participate in such marriages, rather than being in pairs. The difference here is insignificant.

6. The idea that polyamarous people are treated ""equal"" because *everyone* is only allowed to marry one spouse is the same type of ""equality"" where *everyone* is only allowed to marry within their race or sex. This is nonsensical. Everyone being held to the same standard of law does not work when people love people outside of what is socially accepted.

7. Polyamarous relationships aren't any less stable than homosexual relationships or heterosexual relationships. Even if they were, it shouldn't have any weight, as interracial relationships are much less stable than intraracial relationships. To argue that polygamous marriage shouldn't be allowed because of a instability in relationships is also to argue against interracial marriage.

1119,"CMV: If reddit's community cannot drive out hate subs, it is the admins job to do so. If the admins cannot do so, they should try until there isn't a reddit left anymore.",FALSE,0,t3_39hgml,"Givens:

1) Racism, sexism, homophobia, and other forms of hating classes of people are wrong.

2) We have a moral obligation to do right.

3) Free speech also means one has a right to challenge bad ideas, and that we are not obligated to act as platforms for the ideas of others.

Given this, individuals and groups SHOULD NOT promote racism, sexism, and homophobia. In allowing subreddits that do so to function on their platform, reddit is doing so. This is, in fact, wrong, and the admins have a moral obligation to do far, far more than they have already done to drive out hateful communities. 

This doesn't mean that people should be arrested for their speech, only that no one SHOULD, morally, promote hatred. Free speech is kind of irrelevant in the banning of hateful subreddits, or rather, free speech demands that groups have a right to NOT publish hateful rhetoric, and morality demands that groups not do so.

Also, ""BUT FREE SPEECH"" arguments aren't going to work. If I can make a semi-coherent argument on this, I've probably already seen those arguments, so there's really no point in making them.

1382,CMV: While PirateBay is a very handy site to use I ultimately see it as illegal/unethical.,FALSE,0,t3_36kxtf,"So, let me start off by saying that I have used thePirateBay a number of times to download programs, ebooks, software, ect. However, I view it as something that is ""good while it lasts,"" meaning that I will use it until it ends but when it does end will see that it had too. 

It is sort of like when a store wrongly prices a product and I can by it cheaper. I will by the product, but when the store realizes and corrects the prices I come to the conclusion that the prices were wrong and the correct price is 100% fair. To mer there is no debate on whether the lower price was fair; it was not! In order for the store to make a profit and employ workers they need to have the correct prices. Also if they dont correct the price they may have to stop selling the item from the manufacturer and that may cost more jobs. Jobs that normal people like you and I have. It does not matter how much the manufacturer/store makes in a year, it is still their money that they can use for raises, expansion, health care, ect. Could you imagine if we lived in a world where your wealth made it ok for people to steal from? A world  where I could come to your house and steal your car because you have too much money anyways, and dont need that much money.

IMHO the whole freedom of speech argument is a total cop out. To me that is a totally non issues. It reminds me of when slave states in the US turned slavery into a ""states rights"" issues when it is clearly a racism and money issues. Also, if I was to make a website on how to steal senior citizens social security but label it as ""educational only"" I would 100% see the merits of it getting pulled down. Technically it is ""free speech"" but it is speech aimed solely at stealing someone's hard work.

There is also the argument that because thepiartebay does not host any files and only directs, they are in the clear. However, there have been countless times that someone has been convicted of a crime for being an acquaintance, and some states even have bystander laws to punish people for not stopping a crime. If I was to drive my buddy to a bar house where he kills a man, than I will be indicted on aiding a murder. Sure I may have the right to drive where I want to  but that argument will never hold up in court. Even though I only directed to murderer to the scene and will be held partially responsible

851,CMV: As a straight male I should be allowed to frequent gay bars.,FALSE,0,t3_3bx3hw,"I'll try to keep my thoughts as simple as possible. 

Where I live there are only two bars with in walking distance. One of the bars is by all accounts unpleasant. They have sketchy clientele, high prices, bad food, and terrible service. My girlfriend feels uncomfortable there because of the behavior of the patrons and the employees who do nothing to stop it. 

The other bar is a gay bar. It's cleaner, has better service, better drink deals and is much more women friendly (which my girlfriend appreciates). Now I had regularly gone to this bar in the past by myself, usually to just grab a drink after work, watch a wizards game (I don't have cable so I go to bars for my sports) then leave. This past tuesday I brought my girlfriend there for the first time. After about an hour the waiter asked us to leave. He told us it was 'gay safe' and a 'gay space', that they didn't want us taking over there space and that we were making some patrons uncomfortable.  So we paid and left, trying to not make a scene or cause any problems.

Now I've had a couple days to think about this and as right now would be a time that I would have stopped in for a beer, I'm a little pissed.

I feel like I've been discriminated against because of my sexuality which is something that the Gay community has fought to stop. I've always been supportive of the LGBT community, and I don't want to make a straw-man argument, but I can't not see hypocrisy in this. I don't understand how my issue is different then the bakery who refused to bake the cake for the homosexual couple. Them asking me to find another bar is no different then a bigot telling a homosexual couple to find another bakery.",851,TRUE,,TRUE,1
909,CMV: there is no legal or moral argument against allowing incestuous marriage that hasn't been thrown away in pursuit of gay marriage.,TRUE,1,t3_3bbxyv,"To start: **I am *not* saying that homosexuality and incest are the same thing.**

However, any arguments I would normally use against allowing incestuous marriage have been declared void. For example, you can't simply say it's disgusting, because a lot of people find homosexuality disgusting, and society has decided that people's rights shouldn't be inhibited by the disgust of others. Incestuous couples are more likely to have deformed children, but marriage is not about reproduction. Maybe there's some psychological affliction behind it, but homosexuality used to be classified as a disorder as well, but psychologists realized the error of their ways as it became socially acceptable. Of course, any religious objections are right out.

So with the last defenses against gay marriage dismantled, I'm left without any good reason why siblings should marry each other. CMV

Edit 1: Added emphasis.

Edit 2: Stepping away for a bit. I'll be back in a few hours. (8:45pm, GMT)

Edit 3:
Deltas awarded to:
/u/SquirrelPower for pointing out that there is a legal difference between types of classes. /u/the-friendzoner made a similar argument, that the sexual attraction of incest is different than an orientation. 

I don't consider these sufficient reasons to continue the ban, but they are distinct from the reasons given for banning homosexuality, so they fulfill the terms of my post.

I'm sure majority of reddit will pat each other on the back how ""they did it"", how they overthrow a tyrant and reddit will be back to their good ol' days. What a load of shit. Reddit turned into a mob without any grounds to be so angry about Ellen Pao. 

- Her lawsuit has nothing to do with reddit. You might not like it, but that's about it. Plenty of CEO's are dicks or plain abhorrent people, that have nothing to do with their ability to run a company

- She didn't fire Victoria

- Nobody knows why Victoria was fired. It's none of your business anyway

- FPH definitelly wasn't the first time reddit ban a subreddit, harassing and brigading people outside of the sub was always reason for ban, I would like to turn your attention to [this](https://i.imgur.com/A6ORPlL.png). Do you think this is okay? 

- Modtools were like this for ages. The old CEO that is taking her place is having more responsibility for the state of the modtools then Pao ever had 

- She tried to make reddit more advertiser friendly? And this should be like a negative thing? For a CEO? Really?

The vitriol against her was absolutely disgusting with zero base to begin with. Reddit only showed how majority of people here like to bully people. Slow clap guys, you ""did it""

1185,CMV: Edward Snowden failed to gain support from the left because he attacked a democratic president and his administration.,TRUE,1,t3_38rbj1,"If Edward Snowden had revealed NSA secrets during a republican administration, he would have received more support from left-leaning politicians and from liberals and democrats.  Because he presented as a libertarian, and was perceived to have attacked the Obama administration, democrats and liberals were not receptive to his disclosures.   

Republicans generally tend to be supportive of a strong military defense, and so the NSA's actions naturally align with republican leanings.   

So, he received no support from the republicans or democrats, and this has played a part in how his message has been framed in the media, and what our political representatives say about him.

EDIT:  /u/NorbitGorbit changed my view.  He pointed out that following 9/11, both parties went along with passage of the Patriot Act and other government actions (the establishment of the Homeland Administration), and so the climate was supportive to surveillance across party lines.  Had Snowden made revelations under the Bush administration, in that climate, they wouldn't have been well-received by either party.  He didn't use those words exactly, but I think that was his point.  /u/NorbitGorbit, let me know if I misunderstood your post or misrepresented it.

1157,CMV: Reading fiction is a waste of time compared to reading nonfiction,TRUE,1,t3_394d49,"After the number of fictional books and nonfictional books I've read, I've come to the conclusion that fiction is always more of a waste of time than nonfiction. I've read more fiction than nonfiction so let me give some examples. 

In the fiction category, I've read stephen king's ""the long walk"", ""needful things,"" and ""the shining""; i've read pretty much all of crichton's books, and almost all of dan brown books. All are  quite popular books. 

For comparison, the last 3 nonfictions I've read are [skunk works](http://www.amazon.com/Skunk-Works-Personal-Memoir-Lockheed/dp/0316743003/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1433822539&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=skunk+works&amp;pebp=1433822538925&amp;perid=1EH2CEACB9PWNS9GT84H),"" ""[the code book](http://www.amazon.com/The-Code-Book-Science-Cryptography/dp/0385495323)"", and ""[Nothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea](http://www.amazon.com/Nothing-Envy-Ordinary-Lives-North/dp/0385523912/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1433822683&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=north+korea&amp;pebp=1433822683392&amp;perid=11JG0BF3QCH819XQN6N9) ""

See, my view isn't that fiction is boring. However, in the limited span of time I have, I'd rather read 1000 pages worth of Introductory Chemistry, than 1000 pages worth of Needful Things; I'd have learned a lot more in The Code Book about cryptography than anything I would have learned from reading Jurassic Park (some basics about DNA and molecular engineering). 

Because it's such a time sink, the amount of enjoyment from reading fiction is not worth the time it takes to read it. (1000 pages would take 1-2 days to read; I'd rather spend those 1-2 days watching movies or doing other time-sinking things that provides a much greater amount of pleasure). On the other hand, reading 1000 pages of nonfiction, while it would take even longer time, but it would let me get more out of it to be worth my time.

CMV that reading fiction is somehow worth the time that it takes. 

**edit:** I've changed my view in the sense that not *all* fiction are created equal and I probably had been reading too much shitty fiction. I will try to make some efforts to read more nonshitty fiction.

1427,CMV: Black slavery is alive and well in the United States.,FALSE,0,t3_368kws,"Hi, allright so as I see it.
Black Americans make up ~10% of our population but ~40% of our incarcerated.  

Large majorities of our incarcerated population have been sentenced on minor drug and possession charges made possible by the war on drugs.

The US prison system is structured as a profitable venture, those profits coming overwhelmingly from the tax-pool (insofar as I understand this).

The only conclusion I can reach from this is that an institution of normalized slavery exists and functions on a wide scale in the united states.  

Following emancipation, there was a long period where black slavery in America truly did function, with large work camps and prison gulags sourcing labour from the black community after slapping them with minor charges, loitering, etc.  As far as I can tell, this never stopped and has only grown in scope.


Racial minorities in america (overwhelmingly black and hispanic) are obviously mostly incarcerated.  Whether or not our justice system is structurally racist is not the issue here.  It is: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:USA_2009._Percent_of_adult_males_incarcerated_by_race_and_ethnicity.png

I sort of came here from elsewhere on reddit after running into this documentary: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAJLSpUXawE   
(from where I cited the work camp/gulag comment)

Anyway, this realization has made me quite uncomfortable,  that my tax dollars support.. you know, racial slavery,  because even after a brief review of the numbers involved here... yea I don't know what else to call it.   Is that not what is going on here?  Is there something I don't fully understand about how prisons operate?  ",1427,TRUE,,TRUE,1
952,CMV: Sexting is morally wrong no matter the age of both *legal* parties.,TRUE,1,t3_3aztz8,"Huge emphasis on the **legal** aspect of this, as we were both old enough where it wasn't illegal. So I [20M] was talking with this girl [24] from a dating site when we decided to exchange phone numbers. Half of the country is between us (TX and NY), so any chances of a meet up were pretty much slim to none. We're talking and talking when she suggests that we exchange phone numbers. I say yes, give her my digits and we continue chatting. All of a sudden she wants to exchange naked pictures of each other. Sure we were talking each other up and everything, but I immediately got cold feet when I read that text. To me there has always been a fine line between just saying what you're doing and actually showing it off, you know? I guess my family brainwashed me into the don't post **any** pictures of you online mentality because of pedophiles, and my entire life I've followed that order. I've just always held onto the belief that sexting is wrong - period. I mean, yeah there's countless pictures of weiners and boobs all over the internet, but I'm absolutely frightened that my package makes its way to a billboard or something. Obviously that's a near impossible worst case scenario, but I hear horror stories of girls showing off their stash of pictures they've received, and that's enough for me to chicken out.

Abortion is supported by my belief of autonomy, i.e. ""my body, my decision"", but that goes against my belief that vaccines should be required (for things like entering school, etc.). Both abortions and anti-vaccination have the potential to harm others than yourself as abortions could end the lives of viable children and anti-vaccination could harm other children through diseases. Do I have to admit to being a hypocrite, or are my views not contradicting?

1010,"CMV: Telling someone ""They're alive in your heart"" after a death is callous and flippant",FALSE,0,t3_3ai92o,"The advice to remember someone so they don't really die is stupid. If someone's dead, it tears you up inside and that doesn't change just because you remember them. The only things that heal are the religious belief that you'll see them again someday (if you are religious), time (which will eventually numb the pain somewhat), or ressurrection (which doesn't happen). 

EDIT: Several people have pointed out that if you carry their advice with you, it's a way of keeping the essence of their impact on the world alive and another said that if you make an effort to replicate their impact (feeding the homeless in their place) you can help keep their impact alive that way as well. Several people mentioned the idea that people only matter as long as they live and as long as they are remembered which is also true. 

All of these things may be helpful IF it appears that the person doesn't already know it and would benefit from this point of view. Even then, I don't believe it should be said at all until after the main thrust of the grieving process has passed. There's no point in talking to someone of coping with the loss of their leg while it's still bleeding.

1.  Gun control (in the USA) is largely ineffective given Constitutional restrictions
2.  All attempts at nationwide (and some state) gun control has yielded in significant sociopolitical blowback, where political capital was wasted by the Democrats and ultimately led to more people becoming gun owners and taking a stronger stance on the topic.

3.  Being supportive of gun control measures does not logically follow given the Democratic Party's recent stance on Gay Marriage, War on Drugs, Voting Rights, Social Inequality, etc.  It's almost hypocritical.

The claim that Pao was set up for failure holds the obvious implication ~~what~~ that *Yishan* set her up for failure. Despite this, Pao was originally stationed as CEO in the interim. Her role was never even intended to be permanent; how can she be set up on a glass cliff if she was only temporary in the first place? 

The glass cliff theory also includes the idea that the company was performing poorly at the time or was forecasted to perform poorly in the future. This is patently false; Pao presided over an enormous increase in user growth and revenues, a growth curve that had begun well before her promotion. Furthermore, the company's performance was the not the reason for her ouster; instead, it was due to user and moderator dissatisfaction; nothing that was present or predictable at the time of her promotion many months earlier. It is obvious, then, that none the parameters of the glass cliff thesis were met, and is instead a myth perpetuated by feminists media organizations seeking to portray Reddit as misogynistic and sexist.

1314,CMV: There are no good reasons to not wear a helmet while riding a bicycle,TRUE,1,t3_37e6il,"As the title says, I can't find any valid reasons to not wearing a helmet while riding a bicycle. Here are a few of the many to wear one:

**They reduce the extent of any injuries caused by a bike accident**

Bike helmets are proven to make any injuries obtained greatly decreased. The effectiveness of helmets are found to be 85-88% in preventing serious injury. About 70-80% of accidents involve some damage to the head. It is estimated that if children ages 5-15 were forced to wear a helmet, 39,000 to 45,000 head injuries would be avoided, along with 18,000-55,000 face and scalp injuries. I could go on and on with these, but I don't have that much time. If you want more proof, just google ""bike helmet facts"". I've also listed my sources below. 

Sources: 

http://safety.fhwa.dot.gov/ped_bike/docs/b_helmetlaws.pdf

https://sites.google.com/site/bicyclehelmetmythsandfacts/ (NSFW, for some reason there is a picture of a man and woman riding naked. Still good stuff on this page, though)

**Helmets do not interfere with riding the bike.**

Helmets, if they are the correct size, do not get in the way while riding the bike. The only thing they can do is possibly disturb the airflow, but special aerodynamic helmets are made for this, if that is that big of a deal to a person. 

Common Counterarguments:

**It messes up my hair!/It is uncomfortable!/It makes me look like a dork!**

I always hear this, but, you know what, none of these are that big of a deal! I would much rather endure a little discomfort than get a possibly permanent injury to my head.

**But I haven't fallen off my bike in, like, years!**

This one. I hate when people say this. Just because you haven't gotten in a crash in a while does not mean that you are exempt from ever crashing again. This is especially true when travelling on a main road when other cars are a factor.

**They're so expensive!!**

No, just no. An average bike helmet will cost about 10 bucks or less. If you can afford a bike, then you can afford a helmet

Alright, that's it for now. Please CMV!

563,CMV: Green power is the only way to go,TRUE,1,t3_3eeg6t,"the name of the post says it all, I think the eco-friendly energy such as wind farms, solar, and hydro-electric power will benefit us in the long run. although most types of eco-friendly energy creation, as of now, tend to be more expensive to put in place I think that they will pay for themselves over tome and that they are also infinitely better than fossil fuels.  
I also think that Hydroelectric is one of the best replacements for fossil fuels as more than 2/3rd of the world consists of water and many developing countries which rely heavily on fossil fuels in their industries have plenty of rivers and oceans whose energy they can harness; my main examples being india, china, and other asian countries. as well as this some african countries lay along rivers and are situated on coasts and this could help eliminate costs that come with transporting fuels for energy across the continent

1211,"CMV: I don't think being the victim of child sexual abuse gives a person any moral standing to wish for pain, suffering, rape or even the murder of non-offending pedophiles.",FALSE,0,t3_38hutn,"I came across [a post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/360jfx/serious_what_is_you_opinion_on_nonabusing/) yesterday which was asking people what they thought about non-offending pedophiles who committed suicide as a way out of their situation.

Although I wasn't entirely surprised by some of the responses, I was pretty shocked by /u/ReasonsBeyondReason. Among other comments in the post, she supports the [rape](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/360jfx/serious_what_is_you_opinion_on_nonabusing/cr9ukiy) and [murder](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/360jfx/serious_what_is_you_opinion_on_nonabusing/cr9ueh3) of **non-offending** pedophiles and suggests that [they should be shamed for their feelings](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/360jfx/serious_what_is_you_opinion_on_nonabusing/cractq9), even encouraging one outspoken pedophile in the post to [kill himself](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/360jfx/serious_what_is_you_opinion_on_nonabusing/cr9upbg). 

She makes it clear that [she was abused as a child](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/360jfx/serious_what_is_you_opinion_on_nonabusing/crawadv), so to a certain extent I can understand why she would feel the way she feels towards actual child molesters, but I don't think her abuse excuses her comments towards non-offending pedophiles.

In another comment which can be found on her [posts](http://www.reddit.com/user/ReasonsBeyondReason) page, she writes:
&gt;Unfair justice. Forsythia Owen is a hero! That disgusting and degenerate child molester got what he deserved. He got the easy way out what a shame. Would have been better to put him in the general prison population...no exceptions! There is still a possibility that he molested that 4 year old. He was under the influence of alcohol and marijuana. This kind of justice is quick and cost nothing and sends a message to would be degenerate child molesters.

In response to a post about a [woman who was sentenced to 38 years in prison for murdering her boyfriend who she had **wrongfully accused** of child molestation](http://www.nola.com/crime/index.ssf/2015/05/colorado_woman_sent_to_prison.html#incart_river).

I think /u/ReasonsBeyondReason is absolutely disgusting for her comments and I honestly think she is more of a danger to society than the man that sexually abused her as a child.

I'm not an expert in economics but I think the assumption here is a labor theory of value. People look at the number of labor hours and the ""difficulty"" of teaching, plus the social importance of teaching, and conclude that teachers are underpaid. It also pulls on the heart strings to support teachers. The same layman economic presuppositions underlie the idea that sports players are grossly overpaid.

No proof has been presented to incarcerate you. 

In short, how is it moral to treat people like criminals before their conviction? 

I do understand that if an arrest is made, it is sensible that that person be detained (rather important if you literally catch someone committing murder or something violent like this). But until proven being a shadow of a doubt, should you not be detained in a location that is more humane and safe? At the very least, your on room with privacy and no danger. Is this simply not a practical? Would it just cost too much?

694,CMV: Reddit should ban whatever sub they want - they shouldn't have to accommodate for 'free speech',FALSE,0,t3_3db5i9,"A lot of people seem to believe that Reddit should be a ""bastion of free speech"". I disagree with such view for several reasons. I believe Reddit should do whatever it wants to do regarding banning subreddits, restricting content etc for the following reasons:  

1. Websites come and go - Whilst Reddit has been around for a while now, nearly nothing on the Internet is permanent. If people do really care that much about freedom of speech, they'll flock to voat or whatever other website pops up to fill the demand in the market. If enough people emigrate from Reddit, then it'll even whittle down Digg style. Personally, I feel even if there is a certain % of the userbase who leaves Reddit, I feel there will be a significant enough amount of people left to keep Reddit fully functional. Heck, it might even get rid of the nutheads and make Reddit a more pleasant place. 
2. The current downvote system doesn't guarantee open discussion anyway - The current downvote system is far from perfect. It might 'hide' the trolly comments but on certain subreddits, expressing a certain view will lead to a lot of downvotes and populist, sometimes circlejerky, comments often rise to the top. Many people use the downvote button as a 'disagree' button instead of a 'doesn't contribute anything of value' button. Can you really have an open, honest discussion in such environment anyway? 
3. Business reasons - I don't know about Reddit's financials in detail but it needs some sort of income. If they struggle to get advertisers due to PR reasons, Reddit should be able to do ban subreddits and limit content if they want to. Reddit is a private business afterall and not a public service. 
4. Majority of Reddit users don't give a shit - Now I have no proof for this and it would be interesting if there was some sort of poll. However, I genuinely feel the majority of Reddit users don't care whether Reddit bans certain subreddits. Like with many things, I feel there's a silent majority who really doesn't care about Reddit's user policy.

EDIT: Adding to my second point, from the FAQ section of the CMV Wiki:
 &gt; Look, we kinda think downvotes suck. We want all interesting and thoughtful conversations to rise to the top, and the problem with downvotes is that it's perfectly possible for unpopular ideas to be interesting and thoughtful, yet many Redditors instinctively downvote claims they disagree with. The Reddit community has been accused of suffering from polarization and groupthink, and the voting system contributes to this issue.

EDIT2: To clarify my POV: **We, as Reddit users, should let Reddit ban whatever it wants to**. I am not arguing from Reddit's (or the CEO's) POV. In hindsight, I would have worded the title better.  Whilst  points 2-4 stand if arguing from Reddit's POV, point 1 doesn't make sense hence the clarification.

Is it really possible that other men can't be bothered to hold it still and keep it aimed into the center of the bowl or urinal? I am of the opinion that what is perceived as bad aim is actually splash back from the bowl or urinal. I recognize that it isn't always a perfect stream, but even then it's completely manageable given the size of toilets. I don't have first hand experience with anyone else's hose, though, so I could be completely wrong.

231,CMV: All atheists are agnostic by default,FALSE,0,t3_3gxorg,"There's a lot of people claiming to be agnostic atheists instead of atheists. This might have to do with the hateful and condescending views of the vocal minority of atheists. Atheists claim to be agnostic atheists, as if being an agnostic atheist is better than being an atheist.

However, I think most if not all atheists are agnostic. If we found undeniable evidence that God exists (e.g. He appears from the sky surrounded by golden light), then most atheists, agnostic or not, will believe that God exists. In other words, atheists don't believe in God simply because there isn't sufficient evidence. No one is saying with 100% certainty that God doesn't exist.

286,CMV: Westerners' over hostility to less extreme Islamism is uninformed and unpractical,FALSE,0,t3_3gf51n,"Hello

Whenever I see a post about Islamism or conflicts including an Islamist side I see several errors that I will try to summarize 

1- Not distinguishing between different movements, for example mixing Hamas, ISIS and the Muslim brotherhood as one and the same when the literature actions and circumstances of these groups are different even if they were connected as some point or even today.

2- Assuming that Islamist organizations are internally coherent while in many cases there is ideological internal struggle between their members.

3- Misinterpreting the language Islamists use, for example Hamas's famous commitment to the destruction of Israel is a widely held view in the Arab world however It is never explicit that it means genocidal procedure while the killing Christians and Jews 
is explicitly banned (even if they are considered second class citizens by many).

4- The cons of Islamist rule is not weighted against the cons of Military nationalist rule which is often the alternative (I am not saying one is always better than the other).

I am not sure if I need to say this or not but I live in Egypt and I am no longer a Muslim (I am non religious now) .

654,CMV: There is no problem with teaching the American Civil War as being primarily about States' rights,TRUE,1,t3_3dkeyo,"I am an American High School student who was taught 2 different versions of the Civil war throughout my schooling career.

In elementary school we first learned about the civil war in fourth grade. In that unit, we were taught the very bare details of the war: The south seceded when they couldn't keep their slaves, and declared war on the north in doing so, Lincoln was a great guy who freed all the slaves with the emancipation proclamation, and then the north won.

In 8th grade I was taught more details to the story. The south seceded because the right of the states to decide on whether they keep slaves was being questioned, as well as there being the beginning of unequal representation of slave-nonslave states. The south secedes, war begins. I was taught this more comprehensive view in more detail in my junior year of High School, with emphasis on the economic and cultural dichotomy of the north and south: The north was a manufacturing powerhouse that didn't need slaves, and the South was largely agricultural and couldn't afford to *not* use slaves.

I, as a student, preferred being taught the States' rights version of the civil war, as it shows that the South was not comprised of nothing but slave-owning bigots, but that both sides were trying to preserve their way of life. This also allows for a better understanding of the reasoning behind how Reconstruction and Civil rights' issues were handled in the south.

I want to understand why people are against this form of teaching the civil war, so please, CMV

1184,"CMV: In general, liberal education does not work as advertised",FALSE,0,t3_38rhb3,"Most of my friends and I are recently graduated liberal arts students. Ideally, this means that we have [broad knowledge of the wider world (e.g. science, culture, and society) as well as in-depth study in a specific area of interest.](https://www.aacu.org/leap/what-is-a-liberal-education).

However, despite being good students, having graduated from a relatively competitive school (one of the ""public ivies"") most of us are hugely lacking in our ""broad knowledge of science, culture and society"".

Last night, twelve of us hung out at my apartment, and we talked a bit about this, and whether we have a ""broad knowledge of the wider world"".  We played a little game where we would ask the group what we considered a broad knowledge or critical thinking question, and kept track of who could either come up with the answer or answered in the affirmative.

----------------------------------------------------------

Out of the twelve of us:

only 7 said they would be able to solve a simple calculus problem (maximizing the volume of an open faced box given a rectangular piece of cardboard)

Only 5 got the correct answer to a [relatively easy logic problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheryl%27s_Birthday) 

Only 6 got the correct answer to an [easier logic problem](http://i100.independent.co.uk/article/the-incredibly-simple-logic-puzzle-that-youll-probably-get-wrong--x1loz87b5WW). This one bothered me the most, since liberal arts is supposed to teach critical thinking, especially in the humanities, but it was only math and science majors getting this one right.

Only 4 were able to answer a [simple probability problem](http://allendowney.blogspot.com/2011/10/my-favorite-bayess-theorem-problems.html) (The first one). This one also bothered me, since it needs no higher level math, it just involves critical thinking, yet lots of people (all the humanities majors, and some of the science majors) got this one wrong

7 believed that the p-value from a statistical hypothesis test is the probability that the null hypothesis is true

only 6 had written any computer program in any language

only 4 said they would be able to solve the first few (very easy) programming challenges on [projecteuler.net](https://projecteuler.net/archives)

only 8 can read music

only 7 knew that Yugoslavia is no longer a state (the international studies major shockingly did not)

only 3 could name 3 or more of the current nations that used to comprise Yugoslavia

Only 4 knew what [the principle of parallx is](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax) and how it's used in astronomy

Only 3 have read Ulysses

Only 4 have read War and Peace

Only 4 could identify Iambic Pentameter

Only 5 could name 3 or more Central Powers and 3 or more Allied powers from WW1

Only 7 could name 3 or more Axis powers and 3 or more Allied powers from WW2

Only 4 knew what the battle of Hastings was about

Only 4 knew who the Jacobins were

Only 4 knew the difference between deontology, consequentialism and virtue ethics

Only 2 knew the difference between cultural relativism and moral relativism


I have more of this if anyone is interested

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Our majors were:

Mathematics and Philosophy (me)

Mathematics and Economics

Mathematics and Economics

Computer science

Computer Science

History and Political Science

English Literature and History

English Literature and Psychology

Linguistics and Psychology

Biology

Chemistry

International Studies

------------------------------------------------------

My point is that we were all pretty good liberal arts students at a pretty good university, but all had serious gaps in being a well rounded, educated person, who is both good at critical thinking, and has a broad knowledge of the world.

I think that part of the problem is that although our school compelled us to take breadth courses, they were trivially easy (for example, one of us was able to not take any math courses at college, simply because they took AP economics in high school, and they took an introductory Astronomy course that involved basic algebra, another example is that I have never had a college level biology course, I took two easy botany courses that taught virtually nothing about biology). My point though isn't why this is the case, merely that Liberal Arts don't, in general, provide a well rounded education. I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing, but that discussion is afield from this CMV post.

I'd be willing to give deltas if (but not only if):

* You convince me that my friends and I are simply abberations, and that most liberal arts students have better broad knowledge and critical thinking skills than we do

* The questions that we asked each other last night were either too hard, or not indicative of broad knowledge and critical thinking. 

* We fared well enough on the questions such that we could be considered to be well rounded, educated people

* Our school is not representative of most liberal arts educations - other schools compel students to study more broadly and work on their thinking skills better than ours did.

1240,CMV: I think an insurance company only for elite drivers is a great idea,FALSE,0,t3_383u0b,"I believe that there exists a great market for auto insurance that only insures elite drivers.  Personally, I have never made a claim in the 17+ years that I have been driving and paying auto insurance and I believe that I should be paying a lot less than I am.  If I had the money to invest, I would start an insurance company that requires the following of all policy holders, no exceptions:

1) No less than 10 years of driving experience.  
2) Zero at fault accidents in at least 10 years.

3) Zero claims filed with your previous insurance company in the last 10 years.

4) No moving violations in the last 7 years (eliminates one third of fatalities*).

5) No DUI or felony driving convictions, for your lifetime (eliminates one third of fatalities*).

*http://www.carinsurance.com/Articles/How-many-accidents.aspx?WT.qs_osrc=fxb

I understand that the qualifications are somewhat subjective, but I don't see a fair way to avoid that.  You could say that you are still a very low liability if you have only 1 speeding ticket for 5 mph over the limit 6 years ago, but that opens the door for a guy who has 2 tickets.  You have to draw the line somewhere.

To answer some likely questions: if you are on a policy and do something that causes you to no longer , the claim is paid but your policy is cancelled until you meet the requirements again.  No, you cannot add your teen driver to your policy, no matter how great you think they did in driving school.  Yes, your spouse is listed as an excluded driver if they do not also meet the requirements. All others are listed as excluded drivers.   

I believe that enforcing the above would drive down claims enough that rates could be drastically reduced.  The main people who are opposed to this would be those who are butthurt that they don't qualify.  That's just too bad.  This is a (hypothetical) private company that has the right to refuse service to those who do not meet its qualifications, just as other insurance companies do.

The following is just an observation that I tried to backup with data but I have not found anything.  It does not seem to me that car accidents are evenly distributed.  It seems that some people smash up their car every couple of years and others have never caused such an event.  As such, the requirements are intended to disqualify about 90% of the people on the road today, and offer insurance only to those who have consistently demonstrated a high skill level and good judgement.

I believe many good drivers would flock to this service because they are tired of spending their money on a service they have never needed to use and have a very low probability of using in the future.  This is not a service for everyone, but for those who qualify I think it could add a lot of value.  To CMV, you will have to convince me that this is not a viable business idea.  You will not CMV with responses that state any version of ""I'm a good driver but I don't met X, and I think I'm special and should still be able to be insured thru this company.""  Thanks.

1500,CMV: Prescriptivism,TRUE,1,t3_35mgfp,"I've been studying Linguistics as an undergraduate for about 8 months or so now, so this one is important to me academically. In discussions of language, there are typically two camps into which people fall: prescriptivism, and descriptivism. Prescriptivists, think your typical grammarian, David Crystal, Lynne Truss, etc., correcting people's grammar, getting fussy about punctuation, insisting upon proper pronunciation. At the heart of prescriptivism is the idea that there is a way that language *should* be spoken. Descriptivism, on the other hand, argues that there is no such thing as ""correct"" language, that what prescriptivists call ""mistakes"" are just non-standard varieties, and that we shouldn't ever make judgements about people's language.

Linguistics is whole-heartedly and almost exceptionlessly (AFAIK) descriptivist, and as a student, I recognise its importance. The view that there is any single ""correct"" variety of language is obviously misleading from the beginning: which variety? Who says X dialect is better than Y dialect? And judgements against language, I-believe-it-was-Peter Trudgill argued, are actually judgements against people's social class, as supposedly ""incorrect"" language features are often described by the upper classes as being used by the lower classes. And I do mostly agree with it.

But. While I understand all this, I find it difficult to truly shake off the claws of prescriptivism. In particular, the idea that there isn't any ""correct"" language. For example:

""He _went_ to the shops""
""He _gone_ to the shops""

I can accept that in some English dialects, the past participle of ""go"" is ""gone"" instead of ""went"". That's not a mistake. But then take a sentence like:

""Shops went the he to""

This isn't syntactically valid: it doesn't parse as a sentence. You might just be understood, but more likely you would confuse everybody with this sentence, so it fails as communication. If this sentence both isn't a valid sentence, and can't be understood, what other word to describe it than ""incorrect""? It can't be a valid form of language if almost nobody understands it, surely.

So what I'm really seeking, is to understand how sentences like the above can fit into the framework of descriptivism, and for someone to convince me that we can't describe sentences like the above as ""wrong"". Please VCM.

I don't have a ton of reasons, it's just my view, I guess I'd like to see any facts or counter-arguments if possible. I did see that machines have been made that can produce 1 burger every 10 seconds or so, and that McDonalds already implemented automated cashiers in Europe. This is the kind of thing that I think will happen in greater numbers - more automatic cashiers at places like Wal-Mart, even a shift to automated cooks, and warehouse workers (I know there are already some warehouses where robots retrieve ordered packages for shipping).

771,CMV: I'm a Liberal and I think illegal immigration is actually a problem.,FALSE,0,t3_3ckb3d,"In light of Trump's bigoted comments recently making the news, I thought it might be a good time to post this. It seems like some portion of the media has the attitude that any objection to illegal immigration is inherently bigoted.

I believe illegal immigration is actually a genuine problem. I'm aware America in it's current form is a country of immigrants. I fully support legal immigration.

I don't believe the stock line that modern immigrants are fulfilling jobs that otherwise broke, unemployed Americans could not or would not perform. That idea is inherently racist when you think about it. It says one group of people are capable of performing a task that another group cannot simply because of their identity. I'm not saying that immigrants don't perform these jobs very well, but I see no reason to think that Americans and legal immigrants couldn't perform these jobs equally well.

There are plenty of unemployed Americans who aren't able to land jobs because illegal labor costs are very cheap. Companies that employ illegal labor have a significant incentive to keep this cheap form of labor in play, at the significant expense of regular Americans who want to be payed a living wage. Instead of having to pay a decent wage, these companies can get away with exploiting illegal immigrants for their cheap labor. If this wasn't allowed, if the laws preventing illegal labor work were actually enforced, there would be significantly less incentive for people to migrate to the US.

If you're in the Midwest or East, you don't really notice the amount of illegal immigration that's going on. But, if you're in the West, it's hard not to notice. Obviously it's hard to tell who has migrated here legally and who hasn't, but if you visit a Latino grocery store the size of Wal-Mart you'll notice a few things...they're all extremely busy, many of them don't speak English...which makes me think they're either visiting or have not been here very long.

Obviously this is a generalization, but it seems like every family has about 3+ kids. It's not at all uncommon to spot families with 5+ kids under the age of ten. How is this possibly a good thing? There are enough humans polluting our country as it is. Why increase the burden?

Most intelligent people have started to have less children, yet these religious people who are, on the whole, even less educated than we are, show up without decent paying jobs, take jobs that other Americans would have taken and now can't take, and proceed to have an expensive amount of children while having full access to our underfunded public school systems, our hospitals, and generally putting a ton of stress on every public service imaginable (libraries, jails, roads, landfills).

If their kids are sufficiently indoctrinated from a young age in the Catholic religion and adequately against birth control, will they proceed to have as many kids as their parents when they reach child rearing age? For every 3 kids another 3 kids? Is America not sufficiently religious as is? Do we need more religious believers strolling around attempting to inject dogma into our government/culture?

Meanwhile, since these people are showing up with nothing, their kids are often receiving the worst of the worst in terms of education and healthcare. What are the long term effects of that? Not only is the educational system more stressed with these ESL kids, but these kids aren't being adequately educated. Does America have a shortage of unintelligent people? Do we need to create more by putting undue pressure on the educational system? What are the long-term effects? How could they possibly be beneficial and not negative effects?

The media and politicians have a huge incentive to support and bend over backwards to their new huge audience, so I don't trust them to be at all honest in their discussion here.

Again, how is this possibly a positive thing? Why encourage it in the slightest? Are there not enough problems going on in America that you want to compound the problem by adding more people to the equation? More people means more complexity...complexity isn't usually a good thing because it does not make things easier. I don't see the benefit whatsoever. Let a regulated amount of the best and brightest people come here legally and get paid decent wages. Let Americans have jobs that pay decent wages.

Overall, the death toll of conventional airplanes, though small, has vastly exceeded that of airships, yet it is airships that retain the reputation of being death-traps. 

The truth is, airships were an idea that was completely out of step with its times; during the period where they were most economically viable, materials and engine technology, among many other things, were barely adequate to deal with their demands. An airship built to Zeppelin scales with modern materials technology and design techniques would be dramatically stronger, lighter, faster and safer, with aramid fibre skins stretched over composite frames. They would have satellite navigation and meteorology, and onboard weather radar to avoid dangerous weather; computerised systems would monitor hydrogen pressure and static build-ups, modern escape and fire suppression systems would provide a final back-up. Moreover, there is the potential to use solar power and electric motors to run these flying behemoths essentially for free, making them far more economically viable, both for passengers who don't mind a slower, more stately trip and for container cargo. You might even be able to use onboard generated power to crack water to produce hydrogen to replenish losses, though I'm not sure how feasible that would be.

Also, it's very hard to deny that airships are really fucking cool.

982,"CMV: Access to restrooms is a basic human right, and it is wrong for tax-funded spaces to charge money for them, if not all businesses.",FALSE,0,t3_3ao3xl,"I recently was in Europe, and all of their public transportation stations (bus and all of EU rail) made you pay 50c - 1€ to access their restroom. I believe that access to a restroom is a basic human right because of its universality. All people use and need a restroom, regardless of gender, race, or income. They provide a healthy and private space compared to say, a bush or alley. I am not joking - for many people this is a choice they have to make. Public urination is a big problem in urban areas. Being forced to defecate in public is not just unsightly and unhealthy to others, but it also adds personal insult to the injury of homelessness. I saw several people loitering near these payable restrooms asking for 50c to use them, which I don't believe is something one should have to do. To restrict restrooms to those able to pay is morally wrong, and cannot be allowed, especially in places funded by taxpayers.

There are several benefits to opening up public restrooms. People use restrooms to clean themselves as well, so opening them up would increase overall cleanliness. Arrests for public urination would decrease, reducing police and jail costs as well as street cleaning costs. I don't know if respect for the homeless would *increase*, but I think disrespect would decrease as people stop sneering at those asking for money to use the restroom.

Some may say that opening the restrooms to all would make them dirty. About half of these payable restrooms I saw had a person standing there to collect money, who could in the free case just be another janitor (they already have to clean them, no matter how exclusive their restrooms are). I have no sources or math for this, but I don't believe that the minor influx of people into these restrooms would dirty them at a rate faster than the added janitor person could clean with the rest of the janitors.

A lot of touristy places had payable restrooms as well. I can see how one could make the case for a business reserving the restrooms to their customers, but many of these places were just a privatized version of what I described above, selling just water and restroom access.

To summarize, I believe that the small cost in maintaining a free restroom is outweighed solely in possible financial gains, and completely blown away when considering human rights in addition. Still, I imagine that I cannot be the first person to think of this, so there must be some reason why public spaces were allowed to begin this practice in the first place, so I would like to hear what you think on the matter. CMV please.

1166,"CMV: I don't find Whose Line is it Anyway funny, and believe Reddit only pretends to enjoy it because of its unpopularity in the general public and cult status.",TRUE,1,t3_391syd,"Improv, as an art form, is a medium almost exclusively to be enjoyed live. SNL, while having improvised elements, does not fall in this category because most skits are rehearsed (regardless of your current feelings on the show, it has worked to some degree of success in the past). 

Which brings me to Whose Line. The show, while being very  clever and featuring undoubtedly skilled performers, just does not translate through television. This is where my argument will get a little murky, because I'm not entirely sure why it doesn't translate. It would seem to follow that something that's funny in person would also be funny through television. I just know that when experienced live, improv has such a bigger effect on its audience than when seen on television. 

The show, as a result suffered, ratings began to falter, and it was subsequently cancelled. In the aftermath, redditors began praising the show for its genius, claiming how it was unjustly cancelled, etc, etc, Colin Mochrie, etc. Reddit simply pretends to like it because of its unpopularity and cancellation, because that then elevates that redditor above the general public. ""Normal people just don't 'get it.' But I do,"" kind of thing. 

I know this is entirely subjective, and you may think I'm completely off base, but I'd really like to get genuine responses of why you enjoy the show, why you believe it is actually funny, and whether or not there is any truth to my assumption of reddit's reasons for liking it.

777,CMV: I won't support financial abortion unless we also set up a social safety net to make up for it,FALSE,0,t3_3ch8d6,"Financial abortion, aka legal paternal surrender, is a concept talked about among Men's Rights groups whereby they believe men should be allowed to opt out of paying child support. This process would occur sometime after the woman is aware she's pregnant and notifies the man, and then MRAs believe he should be able to sign himself out of being the father if he desires (losing all the other rights of fatherhood like visitation, of course).  

MRAs state that this gives a right to men that they lack in comparison to women, namely that women can choose whether or not they want to be a parent either by carrying the fetus to term or having an abortion.  

I'm not going to argue that point here, as that's been done a million times over. I'm going to say for the sake of this post that I'll agree that men should have this right, BUT:  

*Only if we also create a social safety net to help cover the funds needed for the child to have a good life. Funds that would otherwise have been paid for by the father.*  

According to the UN, children have specific rights that the state must see to. The state has to make choices in the best interest of the child. If we're depriving the child of an income source, then the state has to see to it that the child is taken care of.   

The best way the state can do that if the father opts out of paying is to make up for it themselves through welfare.  

---  

I'm going to anticipate some responses that I want to address. Yes, if a woman can't alone support a child financially, then knowing the father will opt out, she should not go through with having the child. However, it is her choice and her right to do so. I believe that people should be allowed to exercise control over their own body.  

Once the baby is born it *must* be taken care of. (Trying to convince me that we shouldn't care about babies and just let them die if the mother is irresponsible will not work, sorry, I can't be that heartless.)

Also, just telling the mother to get a second job or work even more and find more income is flawed in my view, because poor single mothers probably can't take on many more responsibilities with affecting the child's life in a detrimental way.

Republicans who are still ""fighting the fight against Obamacare"" are just like Republicans who didn't want to pass common sense gun control reform laws that over 90% of Americans agree with after the Sandy Hook massacre. They don't care what's good for America. 
They are opposing *anything and everything with Obama's name on it* because they are bitter that he is president. Their obvious voter suppression tactics didn't work; he won by both popular vote and electoral vote in both '08 and '12.

299,CMV: Animals that attack hikers in national parks should not be put down,TRUE,1,t3_3gcrbs,"Every month or so, we hear about a tragic story of a hiker attacked by an animal (usually a bear) while they are out in the wild. Often times, the animal is unprovoked. But sometimes an animal's instincts will overtake it, and it will perceive a hiker as a potential threat to either it or its offspring. Whenever an attack on a human happens, park officials from wherever the incident occurred place traps to catch and euthanize the animal.

I don't think that animals that attack hikers should be killed. I love the National Park System, and everything they do, but I just don't think that it is appropriate. The NPS was created for the purpose of being preserved. With that preservation comes the opportunity for us as humans to enjoy them in their uttermost beauty, but that doesn't mean we should start altering them for our convenience. 

Yes, wild bears can be dangerous. They're BEARS for heaven's sake! But their habitat isn't ours to make our own. Part of hiking through these parks, whether it's the Great Smoky Mountains (where the North America's largest density of black bears reside) or Yellowstone National Park (where a grizzly killed a hiker just yesterday), wild animals are going to be wild.

1338,"CMV: The simplest, cheapest, most effective way to improve society would be encouraging and participating in more public interaction between strangers",TRUE,1,t3_373dh6,"I am not here to make an exhaustive (and certainly biased) list of what I believe is wrong with society/culture (specifically in America, where I live), but to suggest that all the issues could be moderated (if not necessarily solved) by establishing new attitudes and behaviors in public spaces and around strangers. It seems that my generation (recently dubbed, by some, the Oregon Trail Generation, existing between Gen-X and Millennials) was the first to be raised with explicit ""stranger danger"" warnings and programs like DARE, latchkey centers, etc. Since then, the stigma against strangers has only increased and our default attitude turned closer to fear and suspicion.

It would take a long time to dissect the various causes for this notable shift but at least some are clear: Modern media more constantly and sensationally depicts the negative potentials (often real, but sometimes illusory). The rapid growth of the internet and technology has given negative individuals access to our private lives and information (think 419 and phishing scams). A more connected and globalized society has shown us a greater number of negative outcomes (even when those numbers do not reflect a higher percentage or likelihood).

I'm certainly not blaming technology for this, as the way we use it exists in a complex cycle of innate habits/desires, the capability of the technology, and a reinforcing feedback loop. Many of the issues are, however, exacerbated by technology because it gives us the ease to disseminate fear-based messages (which are naturally stronger than positive messages) and provides us with a secluded alternative to the public sphere. We can easily find people who agree with us, information that fulfills our search, and interactions that provide some positive stimulus without ever having to interact with strangers.

That said, the insular world we have created puts incredible distance between individuals even as it purports to bring us closer together. While it is wonderful that a person can find a community that shares and validates their unique interests, we are relieved of the burden of having to consider and integrate difference. Further, these habits have not only stratified society economically but subdivided it in all directions. For all the openness of the modern world, we are actually strengthening in-groups by creating social networks and dating sites that cater to race, religion, profession, etc. (I've been looking for research to support this statement, but precious little has been done.)

As I see it, nearly all of these issues would be alleviated by reinstating the public sphere as a place for interaction between strangers. I'm not saying you should talk to every person you see out and about and we definitely need to educate vulnerable groups/individuals on keeping safe (and have a police force capable of adequately and appropriately handling the situation). We could begin simply by discussing the arts when encountered in a public setting (ask a stranger what they thought of a movie instead of just your friends) and discussing news in public forums (why can't people in Boston Common have a conversation about the recent trial?). We should be more open to finding all kinds of relationships randomly, whether on the subway or in the grocery store. 

Obviously, there will be lots of discomfort and inconvenience. You shouldn't talk to everyone, all the time, and it will take each individual an amount of trial and error to gauge what is and isn't appropriate. Still, the general outcome seems to be only positive. For most of the us, the worst outcome is encountering more annoying people, but I actually think ""wait til you hear about this guy I talked to at the gas station"" is more interesting than ""I went to the gas station and listened to this podcast that confirmed what I was already thinking."" We would also be afforded new (that is, old) ways of dealing with issues that arise from online dating and MRA/SJW/etc. communities.

Many people will chalk my attitude up to a rural midwest upbringing as a white male. No, I did not grow up in an area where gangs, drugs, etc. were likely encountered on any sort of regular basis; no, I was not at risk of racial or sexual harassment and related violence. I am, though, familiar with those experiences second-hand (my university had students from 35 states and 42 countries, so I was exposed to an extensive array of different cultures/attitudes/experiences) and actually believe my solution may alleviate them to some extent. A portion of perpetrators (admittedly the ones likely to do the least damage) may change their attitude and behavior because of their increased interactions with others. The worst offenders are likely to attempt/commit their actions regardless. Potential victims may actually gain allies and confidence from increased interaction (one specific ex: women who become comfortable approaching and speaking with men in public are more likely to find men who don't just want sex/dating and the women will demonstrate that they interesting, complex, equal people rather than just joining online groups intent on telling us they are interesting, complex, equal people).

Am I really miscalculating the ratio of benefit/danger? Is there some insurmountable barrier to public interaction I'm not considering? Is this happening more often than I realize but just not in my area?

559,CMV: I'm opposed to a higher minimum wage.,TRUE,1,t3_3efcig,"People like Bernie Sanders demand a higher minimum wage, and much of Reddit agrees with him. I disagree. I do not believe this will help poor people, in the long term. 

I'm European, and I've visited most western European countries. I've also been to the US once. I've been there only for a couple of weeks, but I've encountered a lot of new jobs that I had never seen in Europe! 

When I went to an American supermarket, there were people greeting me at the entrance. There were always cashiers available, and there were often two cashiers helping me at the same time: one to scan the goods, the other to bag them. And there was often a person in the parking lot to gather all the shopping carts! 

I have never seen those jobs in European supermarkets, but they were very common in the US. Those jobs exist because of the lower minimum wage. When workers are expensive, business operate on a skeleton staff. But if they're cheap, you can hire more. 

So raising the minimum wage will destroy jobs. The poorest, least desirable employees will find it a lot harder to get a job. 

If you believe that certain people deserve more money, **give it to them**. Vote for a Universal Basic Income, or start a charity. But don't **force** businesses that **voluntarily** provide jobs to the poor to pay them even more, because you'll punish both the poor and businesses.

Of course my credit is shit at this point, but I'm not planning to buy a house or a new car, so it never affects me. Or am I wrong?

I ask because I work with the chronically poor in America, and some of them have racked up $60,000 in medical bills they will never ever pay off. And they know this. But because they aren't really relying on bank loans for anything, it seems to not matter.

I've also noticed as a middle class white person, that every apartment I've applied for has explicitely told me they check renter's history, and not credit score. So not paying medical bills doesn't seem to affect that.

So if it wasn't concious and consentual, then it's still rape.

And if you were given it under a false idea of what you were ingesting, it's arguably still rape. (But if you say, oh sir I didn't know that alcohol makes you make bad decisions it's not rape)

------------------------------

worknman brought up something I didn't think to address, but I meant if someone says ""yes"" and has something in their body that they put in themselves that they knew makes them make bad decision, it's not rape. A drunk person *can* give consent if they consentually got drunk.

So also, if someone attempts to have sex with them and they say ""no"" and are too drunk to fight back, it's still rape, because they didn't give consent.

169,CMV: Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump gain popularity from the same underlying reasons,FALSE,0,t3_3hi4jt,"This is how it appears to me as a non-American. In effect, people are moving to support these two candidates mostly in response to the same set of events:

- Disillusionment with the political establishment. Voters are fed up with the highly polished and spin doctored politicians, with overtly similar views, that make up the rest of the leadership candidates. Moreover they feel the insularity of groups within political circles leads to a strong divergence from doing what is best for the people to doing what is best for the elite. In response they support people with seemingly strongly felt policy proposals, messages, and who have only - if at all, existed at the forefront of mainstream politics.

- A response to the emergence of political dynasties. Hillary and Jeb both feel like rehashes of past presidents, and voters fear an arrogance and weakening of democracy if familial dominance is extended.

- Anger at cronyism and corruption. Support for people percieved to fall less into donor's pockets. Sanders stands against this kind of ""selling out"" and Trump would seem to be rich enough to fund himself. (Reality isn't important here, only what people think).

- Upset at being left behind financially. Sanders talks about raising the minimum wage, organising co-ops and unions and making trade deals beneficial to the American people. Trump talks about forcing companies to situate factories in the USA, especially in cities on steep decline like Detroit. Voter feel these two

- Upset at the pace of change. (This goes in alternate directions so may be less suitable). The USA is deeply split in its range of ideologies, Obama felt it prudent to oppose Gay marriage officially when he first ran for President due to this in order to gain enough votes. With Trump, to quite Iain Dey in the London Times ""Large numbers of Americans are struggling to get their opinions up to speed with the liberal agenda and they are fed up with being ignored...[which] is why a candidate currently percieved to be a joke is leading the race for the Republican presidential nomination"" . Conversely others feel that Sanders would push their nation towards a more tolerant and open nation, and more supportive of minorities and the less well off.

So please, change this l'il Limey's view that these two candidates gain support for offering their (differing) responses to many of the same problems.

446,"CMV: Constitutional ""originalist"" interpretation of the Eighth Amendment cannot justify taking inflation into account, and thus any bail or fine that the Framers and/or Americans in general would have considered excessive in 1791 should be considered unconstitutional by originalists.",FALSE,0,t3_3f73cy,"Originalism is a constitutional interpretive doctrine in which one reads the provisions of the Constitution to retain the meaning that they had when they were originally adopted.  Thus, an originalist (such as Justice Scalia) would say that if the First Amendment was not understood to prohibit public school prayer in 1791, it should not do so today; and if the Fourteenth Amendment was not understood to guarantee a right to same-sex marriage in 1868, it should not do so today.  The rationale for this is that the people, through their representatives, only actually properly ratified those original meanings, so those are the only meanings that should be considered law.  I take no position, in this post, on the correctness of this general originalist philosophy or its underlying justification, except that at the very least I don't think it's blatantly *un*-reasonable.

In interviews and concurrences/dissents, Scalia often brings up the Eighth Amendment in explaining his philosophy, and his frustration with the idea that current Supreme Court precedent applies the ""evolving standards of decency"" test, which he passionately opposes. As I understand it, the standard originalist argument against the extension of the Cruel and Unusual Punishments clause of the Eighth Amendment to, say, the death penalty, goes something like this:

* The people adopted the Eighth Amendment in 1791, and thus forbade ""cruel and unusual punishments"".  
* Another amendment (the Fifth) adopted at the same time specified some rights of a defendant charged with a capital offense.  Captial offense means one you can be executed for.
* Moreover, they kept on executing felons afterwards, and no one really thought this was incompatible with the Bill of Rights they had just passed.
* Thus, the Eighth Amendment can't possibly prohibit the death penalty.

Of course, this is entirely correct, assuming principles of originalism.  So, thus, the originalist-interpreted Eighth Amendment prohibits only those punishments that were considered ""cruel and unusual"" in 1791.

Now, I think it has to go the other way, too.  So if, hypothetically, the modern government wanted to torture someone as punishment, I think any originalist would have to call that unconstitutional as well, even if there was popular support for it, since that was clearly one of the things the Eighth Amendment proscribed when it was adopted.  

So, it seems to me that the proper originalist reading of the Eighth Amendment is one where it prohibits some discrete set of punishments (such as those involving torture), a set whose elements are defined as those punishments that the Framers and/or American society would have found ""cruel and unusual"" (compared to the crime) in 1791, and that set cannot ever change, regardless of how society or the Supreme Court or anything else changes.  Nothing can be added to or removed from that set without a Constitutional amendment.  

Fine.  But what basis is there, then, for not using the same rule when interpreting the *other* provisions of the Eighth Amendment?  If the same logic is used, the Excessive Bail and Excessive Fines clauses should be interpreted as forbidding a discrete set of bail amounts and fines (paired with certain crimes) that were considered ""excessive"" by the Framers and/or American society in 1791.  **And that set can never change, regardless of how society or the Supreme Court or anything else changes.**

I can't think of any reason why inflation, which I think can be fairly described as ""evolving standards of currency"", should be seen as fundamentally different from the same ""evolving standards of decency"" factor that Scalia and other originalists object to so strongly.  During oral argument in *Hollingsworth v. Perry*, Scalia asked the respondents' attorney when prohibiting same-sex marriage became unconstitutional.  Scalia's own answer to that, of course, would be ""not in 1868, obviously, which means never"".  In that same vein, though, when did it *cease* to be unconstitutional to set bail at $1 million, which would surely have been considered ludicrously excessive for *any* bailable offense in 1791?

I don't think most originalists actually hold this view, but I really don't see a principled reason why not, and so as a result, this is my view.  That said, I honestly do believe there likely is such a reason, and that I just haven't thought of it.  So, CMV.",446,TRUE,,TRUE,1
288,CMV: Anti-theists and Westboro Baptist have just as much right to publicly express their views as anybody else does.,TRUE,1,t3_3geljg,"I don't like this view, and I actually want someone to convince me otherwise. Basically, it seems to me that if you believe something is hurting people, you should have the right to tell everyone. If you believe that religion is actually destroying society, then you should have the right to tell everyone, and if you don't then you're a pretty bad person. The same thing for Westboro Baptist, if they really think that homosexuality means you'll burn in hell, then you're a pretty bad person if you don't let them know.

I should say that being violent in the same way as Westboro Baptist is not what I'm talking about. Going to people's funerals and essentially dancing on their graves is wrong. What I'm talking about is people having the right and responsibility to tell people about what they believe is harmful in the world. I'm also strongly against the way that anti-theists talk about religion as if it's a disease, but it really seems to me that if they don't they're a bad person, so I really want to know if there is some reason that I'm overlooking.

331,CMV: People who leave their hometown after High School do better in adulthood,FALSE,0,t3_3g4iv8,"I don't have any statistical evidence, only anecdotal experience.  However, in discussing with my friends and stalking high school acquaintances on Facebook, I see a very strong correlation between people who are successful in life (well paying jobs, more stable marriages, waiting to have children until the can support a family) and people who left their hometown after high school - whether for college, military, or for work.  This is doubly true for people who not only left their hometown, but left their hometown not to the same state school that everyone else from my high school went to.

I'm willing to listen to other opinions or evidence, but it seems that by people leaving their childhood friends and family that they become more stable and responsible adults.  A necessary consequence of this is that I always encourage teenagers to go to colleges away from home and not someplace where all of their friends are going.  Forcing someone to meet new people, re-invent themselves, and discovering how to stand on their own as an adult is in general a healthy thing to do even if it requires taking on a manageable amount of student debt vs. living at home and going to the local college.  

EDIT: Thanks everyone for your anecdotes and experiences.  I agree that it is a correlation vs. causation argument, and that my anecdotal experience is related to my particular non-major metro area upbringing.  I also understand that there are a great many people who did not travel far from home, and are successful by any reasonable metric.  I was really hoping to see any data supporting or disproving my hypothesis, but seeing none, I'll just have to say that other peoples' anecdotes are just as valid as mine, and it's simply a correlation argument.

236,CMV: Female Virginity is a big deal,TRUE,1,t3_3gx0jh,"Hi, i am a 22 years old agnostic living in a conservative Muslim country that is considered a bit modern and open mind compared to other Muslim countries (Tunisia), i've said that so you know that my opinion is not based on religious rules, however it heavily depends on cultural traditions and moral codes that has been implemented into my way of thinking since i pop-up into this world (yeah that sounds a lot like a religion, it just doesn't include an invisible overpowered sky-man) 


Anyway, i'll try to keep this as short as possible and sum up my view toward this subject.


In our culture, a successful person is one who has a successful family, that include having a good job, good wife/husband a decent house and if you're good enough you'll have your own house and a car (yup, that's the dream of 90% of people here) so being raised with that goal in mind, anything that you do that could be considered a threat to that goal is considered **super bad** one of these many things is non-virgin girls, to be more precise, girls who lost their virginity in a non-marital relationship, these women are considered a no-no for marriage and the main two reasons here are religion and men's ego (i honestly believe that religion is made of men's ego so there is only one reason here...) anyway, so far i've been only talking about rules made by invisible people and what men wants, i completely ignored the women perspective here and the fact that this is their body, their choice and they can do whatever they want to, and am okay with that! i won't condemn a girl just because she slept with some guy and stone her to death, i won't even look down at her, but i can **never** imagine myself marrying her, why? because i cannot stand the fact that someday, someone, could look at me and say: 
&gt;""your wife was great 2 years ago ;) ""  

That's not cool bro, it's very embarrassing, and yup, the counter-argument for this would be : 

&gt;your wife is your life partner, not an object that you own


well, i don't want anybody to fuck my partner o_O !! even in the past when we didn't even knew each other, that's my view on this. 


Also, another argument that i would like to hear your opinion about is that i don't want to live in a society where kids are having sex, no offense but, [16 and pregnant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16_and_Pregnant) has 5 seasons! and i read all the time about 12,13,14,15 years old kids having sex, and i believe the reason this is happening is due to this ""openness"" that western countries have about sex and that's why this kind of things is very rare in a conservative society, this is the only positive point that i can come up with regarding my view on the subject, the rest is like i said, a pure ego of a selfish men dominant society, but if it protect our kids, i think it's worth it, it's also the reason of a an ultimate boring amateur sex life which is the main reason of cheating and divorce but that's an after-marriage subject lol.


So, western men (or anyone who is okay with non-virgin wives) how can you change my view on this ? 


**EDIT:**

It seems that i missed a point that come up to many of you here : 
&gt;Man virginity. 

Yes, ideally a man should stay virgin too, and from a religious perspective he'll had the same punishment as the women which is 100 lash, no idea where the stoning come from but again ignore the religion crap and no none of this happen in my country/culture, however, due to other facts like men are more likely the ones who had the job and the money, and that men are the one who have the option to ""look out"" for their future wives, this will make women more vulnerable to this virginity rules, since they are the one who wait and just decide to say yes or no, while men have the ""option"" to choose, which make the pre-marriage sex ""sin"" for men a lot less important compared to women, and of course you cannot ignore the ""physical evidence"", since we are far from living in an ideal world, a man could have sex as much as he want and just lie about it, while a woman cannot do that (well she can but most of the time they cannot)      


**Another EDIT:** 

Sorry but i missed another points : 
&gt;why men want to control what happen in the wife's past which back then the guy has no idea that this girl even existed. 

Well, i think it's all related to that ""life goal"", if a girl (or man) take the risk of threatening that goal by having sex then they are simply considered bad people, and no one would like to marry a bad person (i have no idea about forgiveness option though).


&gt;what if the girl was raped ? 

I personally have zero problem with that, but i think it's also a no-no thing in this culture.  


Thanks

She got torn apart on social media for being racist. Although I can see how this impression is in bad taste, I cannot see how it is racist.

115,CMV: It is more valuable for an English speaker to learn an East Asian language than any European language,TRUE,1,t3_3i283w,"If you genuinely have an interest in an European country or language, then that beats any reason to learn an East Asian one. However, learning Mandarin Chinese, Japanese or Korean is more valuable than learning any European language.


-Travel

It's easier for Europeans to learn English and harder for East Asians to learn English.
Most Europeans at the very least speak basic English, and most East Asians only know English words.
You can travel across Europe only knowing English, but in East Asia it helps more to know the language.
I don’t consider places like South America and China to be developed enough to travel through, other than tourist spots catering to English speakers.


-Media

When it comes to media, East Asian countries have their own isolated worlds. Going through their music, films, television and books can almost feel like visiting an alien world since so little reaches the west. 
Specifically Japan and South Korea are economic powerhouses and understand the importance of [soft power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_power), and as a means produce a lot more films, music, games, comics, literature and TV than any European or South American country.


-Availability

European languages have more speakers than East Asian languages, but most Europeans already speak English.

For an American there may be a lot Latin American immigrants, but there are Asian immigrants everywhere in the world.

East Asian languages might not be as widely available, but their populations are educated, travel a lot, and have [more native speakers than other European languages.](http://i.imgur.com/SDrGTr8.jpg)


-Difficulty

East Asian languages are said to be notoriously hard by Europeans, but with technology in just the recent years it has become a lot easier. Chinese characters, hangul and Japanese writing systems can now be learned on your smartphone by playing games with apps like memrise or anki.

A lot of European-language speakers complain about how complex European grammar tends to be, whereas East Asian grammar often is “logical” and straight to the point (with exceptions, as any language). 
If you disclude writing systems, East Asian languages would be easier to learn as a spoken language than European ones for someone who has experience with neither.


-Cultural benefits

It’s almost as if their worlds are isolated from ours.
Learning a widely different language helps us understand the structures of our own languages. Learning about a completely different culture helps us understand the uniqueness of our own culture. 

European cultures are often so similar that we only tend to think of simple things as being differentiating between countries, but what makes us unique as westerners becomes much more apparent when compared to a country at the other side of the world.

140,CMV: I am racist against Gypsies,FALSE,0,t3_3hra98,"I am racist against gypsies - There, I said it. When I say I'm racist I don't mean that I think they're an inferior group of people, or that they should be exterminated and kicked out of my country, it's just that I can't stand them. 


In every country in Europe you have groups of people who are marginalized, profiled and suffer discrimination - Gypsies are frequently included on the list. And why is that? It's not because they have darker skin color, in fact I'd argue Gypsies are ethnically a diverse group with sub-ethnic group - It's because of their culture. 

It's hard to not be racist against these people when everytime I see one of them on the street they will either beg and try to pickpocket you or try to sell illegal products (or legal products without license) and if you're lucky they won't threat you with a knife to handle the money.

And don't even get me started on Gypsy neighborhoods, ghettos and places where they live, it's impossible to go in there without goods and leave in one piece, those are literally no go zones in my country and the police goes in there with a group of fully armored cops with MP5's (similar to SWAT in America).

They always complain about how racist society is against them, yet they don't allow their kids to go to mandatory school years and basically force them to work for cultural reasons. They complain about discrimination, but they have no problem starting a fight with you for no reason, and if you dare fighting back be 100% sure that they will call the entire family to kick your ass and possibly put you in a coma. There's no escaping that.

You are all thinking that I'm terribly racist, but this is the only ethnic group I have a beef with, I don't have problems with Africans who are a very discriminated group in my country as well - In fact, my girlfriend is half-Gypsy and I love her very much, but she was adopted and raised by a non-Gypsy family and so she doesn't have the culture in her - And trust me, if you think I'm racist you'll be surprised to know she hates Gypsies with a passion that isn't even comparable to what I'm exposing here.

What should I do? I feel bad and terrible and evil, but I can't help it, it's the only group that I'm prejudiced against. Oh, and if it's relevant I was robbed by a group of 10 Gypsies when I was younger - I didn't lose valuable goods, but it affected me deeply.

If people want to be integrated in society, they need to minimally adapt to cultural norms. Of course people don't hire Gypsies, no one wants to risk hiring someone who, at the slightest disagreement and beef with you can call an entire family to kick your ass. Oh, and obviously not speaking native tongues with a proper accent and lacking basic education because your parents voluntarily choose to deprive you of it also doesn't help.



EDIT - Some people are having problems with me using the word racist to describe myself, I think it is accurate because not all racism is supremacy and there's subtle and institutional racism, but if you don't agree with the use of the word you can still address my prejudice because the word used to describe it is not that important, what's important is how I feel about this group of people",140,TRUE,,FALSE,0
268,CMV: Everyone does not have equal value,FALSE,0,t3_3glh5j,"Commonly it is stated that every human has equal value, I do not believe that is the case. 

I personally do not think there is such a thing as objective value as I believe that the concept of value is a human construct. I think that the value a person possesses is determined by the value that he/she and other humans consider him/her possessing. Following that line of reasoning it is quite evident that everyone does not have equal value as everyone is not treated as if they have equal value.

Still, i would like to take it one step further and say that everyone should not be considered to have equal value. It is hard to define value but for simplicity i will use the most common social construct for value measurement: economics. I will try to explain my view with the following analogy:

You find yourself facing the option to either pay for Adolf Hitler’s or Nelson Mandela’s life. Most people would not hesitate before choosing to save Nelson Mandela. Thus they value him higher than Adolf Hitler. I would argue that this is the morally best decision.

So, am I missing some central point, or maybe I am defining value in a poor way?

At any rate, these countries have a history of an ethnic population and when one thinks of Sweden, there's a certain image just as when one thinks of what and who constitutes any specific country. I would hate to have Sweden be overrun by rampant immigration from any country (my problem is not with the Muslim population specifically/Middle eastern immigration but the idea of rampant immigration in general) just as I would hate for any other country, let's say Bangladesh, to be overrun with let's say, British immigration.

167,CMV: Philosophy is Not Distinct from the Scientific Method,FALSE,0,t3_3hiaiz,"First, I'm not saying philosophy is useless. I'm claiming that everything of use in philosophy is included as an integral part of the scientific method.

What we normally refer to as the distinction between philosophy and the scientific method is really a matter of degree and not of kind. A good philosopher takes observations about reality and tries to fit them into a logical scheme of explanation that is consistent with everything that has been observed in the past. That *is* the scientific method - or, more accurately, it is a part of the scientific method. The extra part is the empirical work of trying to validate the explanation (or hypothesis) by making further observations.

I'm arguing that what makes us call something ""philosophy"" instead of ""science"" is the distance the conclusions are away from the observations being used. If we are musing about the theoretical possibilities of a probability density of quarks, then we're doing science. If we're musing about what kind of actions lead to living a content life, then we're doing philosophy. The only difference being to what degree our hypotheses have to rely on logic alone to extend their reach because available and confirmed observations for such complex subjects are still way beyond our reach. We're still doing science. We're just out on the ledge.

I think the only reason this is even confused is because of a historical coincidence. We discovered philosophy first. It makes sense, because at the time the range of empirical observations we had available to us was tiny. I argue we discovered religious hypotheses first because they only need intuition to get off the ground. The next thing that would occur is the discovery of logic. We still can't build particle accelerators, but we can start to get serious about self-consistency in our arguments from intuition. This helped, but we still had another breakthrough to make. That was the scientific method. Where we finally realized that logic and intuition must be tempered by careful and exact measurements. Otherwise, it will all just collapse into my seemingly self-consistent logical framework versus your seemingly self-consistent logical framework - or as we usually refer to it: the Middle East conflict (it has many other names).

And so because of the circumstances of history, we came to see the scientifc method as separate from the philosophical method. They even referred to science as ""natural philosophy"" at first. It soon became clear that this wasn't just another aspect of philosophical study. I think the situation was the exact opposite. Everything useful in philosophy is contained within the ""forming a hypothesis based on existing information"" part of the scientific method. In this sense, philosophy is distinct from biology. Biology is a specific application of the scientific method. Philosophy is a key part of the process, but it does not exceed the process.

Or at least I think it doesn't. Change my view!",167,TRUE,,TRUE,1
1055,CMV: I shouldn't kill Hitler.,FALSE,0,t3_3a3p2l,"Let's assume I have a time machine, knowledge of the temporal/spatial coordinates of Hitler across his entire life, and means with which to end his life. However, I can only use this time machine once, so any alterations of history caused by my time machine are permanent.

In the present, the holocaust has already happened. At this point in history, there is a fixed and finite quality of tragedy attached to it. However, as it stands, the Holocaust was not my fault. I wasn't alive at the time, and had no role in the buildup to these events.

If I kill Hitler, I may prevent the particular tragedy that we know in history from happening. But if in preventing this tragedy, a new one that I didn't predict happens, this IS my fault. By altering time, all new fatalities can be directly linked to my action. 

In short, I would rather attempt to repair damage done by someone else than undo old damage and potentially cause new damage.

1283,CMV: Making money by being an online entertainer (like Youtube or Twitch) happens to the lucky few and it's safer to just get a real world job.,TRUE,1,t3_37p0d8,"To me, online entertainment is such a flip of a coin. You either get a partnership or you don't, and even if you do get the partnership, there's no saying that what you make will be enough to live off of, so it's probably just safer to get a real job.

For Youtube, it seems like you need to be the following to be successful:

* A young attractive person (or at least a person with an attractive voice) that appeals to some major demographic (teenage girls, LGBT teens, sports fans, etc.)

* Someone who was already famous on a different social medium

* A Let's Player

And in all of these, you need a certain budget to spend on making your videos (light, camera, a crew maybe?) and that's not including the money you need for specific videos (e.g. a Let's Player needs enough money to buy new/big budget games in order to attract attention, a make-up channel needs to buy TONS of products, clothing channels need to shop on a regular basis, etc.).

Twitch has the same problems as a Youtube Let's Player; in order to be noticed, you need to buy really popular games and/or new games, and those are rarely cheap; most games are up in the $60+ range, not including DLC or even the equipment needed to stream at a constant frame-rate for long periods of time. 

Even if you DO get popular on either of these platforms and get a partnership, Twitch takes half of your subscription profits, leaving you mostly depending on possible donations, and Youtube takes a lot of your ad revenue (not including other Youtube-related partnerships you might have [cough cough Nintendo cough]). 

If you ABSOLUTELY need to make money on one of these platforms, or a similar platform, then you should either be rich or have had a real job long enough that you have enough money to survive.

1027,"CMV: If you support the right for transgender people to use the restrooms and locker rooms of their choice, you have to let all people chose which room to use",FALSE,0,t3_3abpt5,"Given the claim that transgender people should be able to choose whichever restroom or locker room they choose based on their own self-identification, it is illogical to say that I, as a man, should not be able to choose to go into a women's restroom or locker room. For simplicity, I will use just ""restroom"" going forward, but mean for these to be treated equally unless you have an argument that hinges on a distinction between a locker room and restroom.  

Let's leave aside the single-user restrooms, as we know that people of all types use the ""wrong"" room at times due to lines, messiness, out of order, etc., and no one thinks that's a big deal. 

Let's assume it is valid for a man to say he feels like a woman and that identity crisis / condition justifies his choice of restroom. If that is the case, surely it is not his wearing of women's apparel that conveys that right upon him. If that were so, any man could dress as a woman and that would earn him the right to use the restroom of his choice. The same argument would be made for any gender specific behavior (wearing of lipstick, shaving his beard, carrying a purse, etc). 

Further supporting the claim that it cannot be behavior is the idea that is a logical prerequisite for transgender to be an accepted idea: that gender is a social construct. If this is the case, a natural man can dress and act in ways that society expects of women and still fully identify as a man. 

Therefore, it is only the internal situation, the mental state, that makes the difference between whether he can go into the women's room or not. If that is the case, there can clearly be no independent rule for determining if he is ""serious enough"" about it to make it acceptable (and legal, depending on local laws) to stroll into a women's restroom. 

I can anticipate two substantial arguments:

1.  Most transgender people have brain chemistry / structure that corresponds to the opposite sex (sex dysphoria), so there is a biological link that is definite and verifiable. Rebuttal: This is not the case for all transgender people, so while some people may be ""certifiably"" qualified to use the other restroom, there isn't any bright line to tell us who isn't so qualified. Further, there are those who do not identify with either gender. Should those people be told that their gender identity doesn't matter and that they should have to use a particular restroom based on sex at birth? 

2. Transgender people have years of therapy and possibly surgery, and that is what gives them the right to choose to use the restroom of the opposite sex. Rebuttal: This would mean that any transgender person who hasn't sought therapy or surgery, for any reason, including cost, availability, etc., does not have that right. 

I am sure some will also focus on the safety issue, saying that it is safer for a transgendered person to use the restroom that corresponds to his/her identity. However, that does not in any way impact the argument that others should also be able to have a choice. 

Obliviously, some support unisex restrooms as a solution, but that is a technical solution, not a rebuttal to this argument. 

In short, I should be able to use whatever restroom or locker room that I want, without question, because no one has any way to verify or validate my gender identity. If it is not based on my genitals, there is no valid basis for telling me I must use the men's room.

49,"CMV: ""Bulbous"" is a far grosser word than ""moist.""",TRUE,1,t3_3iq0nj,"(disclaimer: there is probably going to be some grody text below, so beware)

You've all probably heard it: ""moist"" is the grossest word in the English language. People responding to a [New Yorker Twitter poll](http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/words-came-in-marked-for-death) about the worst word in English overwhelmingly selected ""moist."" [Buzzfeed](http://www.buzzfeed.com/hunterschwarz/why-moist-is-the-worst-word-ever-6zgv) talked about it in a full-on image-and-text bonanza. There's even [scientific research from Oberlin University and Trinity University (San Antonio)](http://mentalfloss.com/article/64984/science-behind-why-people-hate-word-moist) on why we hate the word so much. It's pretty well-documented: we don't like the word.

However, I'd like to propose that ""moist"" is definitely not the worst word in the English language. There are plenty of words that are ""worse,"" but I'd like to focus on ""bulbous"" for the purpose of this CMV.

Think about it in terms of the ratio of possible positive uses of the word vs possible negative uses. ""Moist"" has a lot of positive connotations. You might describe a delicious chocolate cake as ""moist,"" for example. You might also use moisturizer if your hands are feeling dry. (I mean, we're still selling things with that name! You'd think we'd switch from ""moisturizer"" if it were truly despicable.)

Compare this with ""bulbous."" I cannot think of a single positive connotation associated with the word. It's a word you'd use to describe something like a wart on a foot or a disgusting growth on a six-month-old container of yogurt. Using this metric, ""bulbous"" is a far grosser word.

The other argument I'll make here is that the mouth shape you make to say ""bulbous"" is way worse than that of ""moist."" You have to twist it all sorts of disheartening ways - closed to open to squished close again to open again to a gross final-s sound. Comparatively, ""moist"" is a walk in the park - one quick flare of the mouth and you're done.

302,CMV:I think the USA should split into different countries and other countries should merge.,FALSE,0,t3_3gc01w,"Ok so I went looking for this question in the archive but couldn't find anything, so forgive me if it's already been stated. 

I believe things would be better for Americans if America was to split into different countries. I just don't think having over 320 million people living under one federal government is particularly practical. I'm not one of the guys that say ""Americans have lived under the guise of freedom and democracy for so long they've forgotten what it means."" All I'm saying is, it doesn't seem very practical. 
I mean really, if you though of all the people in the country that agree with you on at least ten key political issues, I think that would be enough people for a whole country. 

If the US split, that would mean that the each individual citizen would have a lot more say so over their own country. In terms of just the logistics, it just seems better than having one huge department for so many people (e.g. IRA) and I find it bizarre how we talk about certain issues like gun control when different gun control laws would be better for their each individual region. 

It would mean more democracy.

And it's not just the US. I think most world borders seem outdated to their current population...possible Brazil.. and China and India would split into a lot more different states. (Yes, I know how ridiculously unlikely this sound, but it's just my opinion.)

Furthermore, some countries seem to be so economically intertwined it seems like it would benefit them to fully merge together. Benelux, the Baltics, (I would say the Balkan but nobody likes Serbia apparently,) the Nordics, Central Asia, (not sure how the rest of the Caucasus feel about Azerbaijan)

You guys know what I mean.
My point is that yes, I know this is unrealistic and probably never gonna happen, but truth be told, I believe it would be better for the individual citizen and more democratic for each newly created country.
 

Edit: if anybody else have anything else to say, **please** feel free to do so! I'm greatly curious to your opinions on the hypothetical changes for each region. What language would be spoken? What currency would be used, and how? Let me know your opinion!

592,CMV: Convince me that life is worth living.,TRUE,1,t3_3e7k7h,"Before anything else, let me say that I am not, nor have ever been depressed, suicidal or abused in any way shape or form. My life so far has been somewhat sheltered. 

A while ago a stumbled upon the idea, that since entropy can only increase, there will be a time without humanity. A time where all you've done, and all you could have done will be gone, forgotten. The universe will be cold, homogenous and all that has ever been, will fall into oblivion.

Allied to that idea, I also do not believe in free will. You see, we came from stardust, and we will go back to being stardust. I also am not religious and I'm extremely skeptical. 

I do not see meaning in any of it. Whatsoever. I wanna change that. I've actively trying to change that for about 2 months or so, but am yet to stumble upon an idea worth living for. So far I've: Read the book 'A man's search for meaning', I meditate and work out. 

Can you guys give me some insight on why I should get out of bed?

900,CMV: People who drive loud cars and motorcycles are inconsiderate assholes,TRUE,1,t3_3bfrve,"It's my view that people that drive motorcylces and cars with those loud mufflers are simply inconsiderate in that they don't care about other's peace and quiet.  
  
I've always found them annoying, say you're reading or studying at a cafe and they roar by louder than an invading Mongolian horde. God forbid they stop at a light since now you're stuck listening to that ungodly chortle for a good minute or so.  
  
I'm a single parent now and live by a fairly well travelled road. They wake my baby up consistently, and he has a hard time with his sleeping habits.  
  
It's a choice to make your vehicle that loud, not a necessity. On top of that, the rider or driver does not have to hear his most of his own racket since most of the sound is projected backwards.  
  
These people are assholes. I wish I could wake them up every 15 minutes with their own stupid vehicle.

***EDIT:***   
  
I had no idea this post would get this big and, as much as I'd like to, I can't possibly hope to discuss this with all of you. Thank you to everyone, on both sides of the issue, for your reasoned and very interesting replies.  
  
The argument that got me closest to changing my view was surely that of safety. Other people are saying being loud is not as important for safety as actually driving well on a motorcycle, and this seems to be coming from cyclists as well, so unless I see some sort of peer reviewed study over anecdotal evidence that line of thinking isn't doing it for me.
  
My favorite arguments were those along the lines of ""It's a free country, you're the one that's being inconsiderate by expecting the riders to be silent."" The image of some tatted up Hell's Angel roaring through town and impinging on the hearing of 500 people and then screaming ""IM BEING OPPRESSED"" when someone suggests he tones down the throttle is simply delicious.  A special thank you to everyone who called me a pussy via PM. It's good to know you care so much.
  
I also learned that the sound that irritates so many of us so well is the sound of straight pipe exhausts. Cheers all!  
  
***EDIT 2:*** 
  
/u/ToastitoTheBandito did manage to change my view on this. [Here is the link to his comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3bfrve/cmv_people_who_drive_loud_cars_and_motorcycles/csmj6kc)  Thank you Toastito, and thank you for being considerate to others.
  
Just a caveat here, there's a few comments in this thread that highlight the problem with some drivers very well. I'm not gonna call anyone out by name but the gist is that I'm annoyed over a minor inconvenience and I should get over it, people like driving loud cars and they're gonna keep doing it.   
  
I don't think any new parent would call it a minor inconvenience after spending 30 minutes putting a baby to sleep only to be woken up 5 minutes into his nap by a purposely loud vehicle. **But this post isn't JUST about me, or my baby.** These drivers drive past countless people. People who are gravely ill. People who own dogs that will shit on the carpet because they're scared of the sound. Nursing homes. Someone with a migraine headache. People who work the night shift. And all these little acts, each one is a little fuck you from the driver. And all these little fuck yous add up to one huge mega fuck you to your community. **People with empathy get mad at this not just because it inconveniences them but because they know it inconveniences many others as well and the act is seen as grossly disrespectful because of that.**  
  
One PM I got said:  
  
&gt;I drive a loud car. Why? Because I like it.  
  
He doesn't take the time to think, ""How will my actions affect those around me? Is there any chance the thing I am about to do will harm someone, and, if that is the case, should I still do the thing?"" No, this person doesn't give a shit. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the very essence of being inconsiderate. ^and^an^asshole

104,CMV: Airshows are totally unnecessary,FALSE,0,t3_3i5e6u,"Hello folks,

As you may have seen footage of a disaster in Sussex during an airshow, it made me think. I am always met with an argument that ""Anything can kill and you should probably hide in a bunk."" or ""Driving is dangerous too"". Well, this is different. Driving is a necessity right now and I cannot wait for a day in the future where driverless car can save millions of lives. I can understand a show in a remote place where people consciously make the decision to take their kids and watch it. I am fine with that although it makes me question the human race. Are we so limited in finding ways to entertain ourselves that we're okay to risk lives of the pilot and innocent children who are not adult to make the decision themselves? People also bring the argument that the accidents like this are rare. A quick search on google tells me that such accidents happen every year. Again, how can you live with your conscience that something that you support and feel entertained has killed people and brought grief in someone's family. 

I am still struggling to find answer to this. How can you explain a show in Sussex where the people who died may not even be remotely interested in the airshow? It's a matter of luck. A brain freeze to a pilot and it's instant death depending where the plane might crash. Today, it's the road. Tomorrow it could be a school. Also, I have heard arguments that airshows provide money to the museum. Again, are we so limiting in our intelligence that we cannot find other avenues to fund the museum? I wouldn't lie that it's amazing to watch the feat we can perform in the sky and the adrenaline rush that people crave but when it has costed lives and traumatized people living in that city, it's one form of entertainment that we can totally live without.

Thank you.

You could replace the word ""group"" with anything: religion, race, color, etc. Sure, religion's the largest group, but if religion were to disappear any day, there would still be sectarian fighting.

730,CMV: The financial crisis in Greece represents a significant defeat for the Left &amp; Socialist politics,FALSE,0,t3_3cx6oo,"I'm European (England), as a result I've been watching the Greece situation unfold quite ardently.

It is my view that spending within your means is a moral obligation, regardless if its personal finance or government spending. Therefor I see the tactics employed by Tsipras and his party as cynical at best and downright reckless at worst - it's essentially been an effort to blackmail the Eurozone. As a result of this, I have sympathy for the Greek people as they will bare the brunt of the consequences from all this, but admittedly my sympathy is quite limited as they voted quite overwhelmingly in favour of supporting Tsipras when it was quite clear what could happen.

At the time of the referendum there were rallies in Scotland to support the 'No' vote, as well as France. These are areas with a very heavy left-leaning population (the SNP in particular in Scotland were also convinced that anti-austerity would work). Coupled with this, on Reddit I've seen a lot of people arguing that it is in fact not Greece's fault and the blame should be placed upon the lenders.

Obviously I do not agree with this standpoint as it paints Greece as some kind of foolish child who has no ability to look after itself. All this got me thinking - it is my view that those shifting the blame away from Greece do so to save face in the fact that the traditional left wing idea they may hold close - that of anti-austerity - has clearly not worked and instead has made things much, much worse.

I believe that Greece's situation represents defeat for the anti-austerity platform as a whole and the left wing ideals it represents.

I used to be a hardcore Republican who thought poor people didn't have it THAT bad and wealthy people deserve to live 100x better because they work harder.  Now, I see the real challenges average people face, especially in the ghetto.

* Having real world experience will help you just as much (you'll encounter lots of people, learn your strengths and weaknesses), if not more than spending years in college ""finding yourself"".  If you have no idea what you want to do in college, you're going to waste lots of time.

* Lots of college kids are entitled because parents/government pay for everything.  And they think they automatically deserve a high-paying job just because they graduated.  Nope, gotta work your way up from the bottom.  Nobody's too good for an entry-level job.

* Oh, and it doesn't hurt to have a little more on your resume.

1234,CMV: Stereotypes are valid and using them to prepare for social interaction is a good idea.,FALSE,0,t3_386k3w,"First, I can present as arrogant and self righteous and I am aware of this but do not mean to be. I am black. I have friends of Caucasian and Chinese descent. When I interact with them, the stereo types I have heard about their race is usually reinforced by their own actions. 

I'll get more in depth; i deliver Chinese food in southeast Dallas.  A stereotype of blacks is that we are notoriously poor tippers. I cannot disagree. In the years of my employment, which provides for me and my son surprisingly well, I have learned through direct observation that that stereotype is based in reality. Whites tip me, Hispanics tip me, Asians as well; blacks...?ha! I digress but I hope my point is clear. I approach a known black customers house knowing the chances are that they will not tip me. It minimizes the dissapointment. It is beneficial to me to enter into these interactions using a stereotype to my advantage. Granted, my emotions are not *that* important but I truly feel better knowing how this interaction is *probably* going to go, and that's a benefit. Its safe to expect a tip from whited or hispamices, etc. and there's no cautionary warning in the form of a stereotype regarding these races. 


I know that may be a flimsier example but I think it suffices to illustrate my point. If you are going on a date with a white person, assuming they can't dance may and provably will save one from a potentially awkward situation. Knowing, or expecting(due to the stereotype) that a Hispanic might work hard for cheap can and probably does lead to financial benefits for shrewd entrepreneurs.

I have no sources for this its just a gut feeling. I think stereotypes are usually valid and can be used to my benefit. CMV!

1373,"CMV: Price gouging during natural disasters is a good thing, and should not be banned.",TRUE,1,t3_36nvdo,"This came up in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy for me, since I live in an area of NY (Long Island) that was fairly heavily effected.

After the storm, generators and gasoline were in very high demand and very short supply.  Due to [NY's price gouging law](http://www.ag.ny.gov/price-gouging), gas prices rose only very modestly after the storm, and many gas stations had incredibly long lines.  Generators were basically unavailable at any price.  

If price gouging had been allowed, the high prices  would have had two effects, both beneficial:

* The price would have attracted needed items from outside the effected area to come in via unusual means.

Normally, gasoline was delivered by pipeline.  But due to the flooding, the main pipeline terminals were knocked offline.  If gas had been, say, $6 a gallon in NY, every gasoline tank truck in the Northeastern US would have started heading there full of gas.  On a 2500 gallon truck, you could make $5000 per trip by hauling in gas from Binghamton or Boston.  And I think most tank trucks are even bigger than that.  Likewise, every generator along the eastern seaboard would have been heading for the area.  Because the price wasn't allowed to rise though, there wasn't the monetary incentive needed to get people to do crazy things to overcome the logistical challenges.

* The higher prices would have caused people to conserve.

People panicked when they thought supply of gas might be unavailable.  They'd flock to any open station and have huge lines, even if they had enough gas in the car to last a few days.  When the price rises substantially, it will make people conserve more, and leave what's left for people who really need it and are thus willing to pay the temporarily higher prices.

321,"CMV: Baseball is not an interesting, tactical or even skillful sport.",FALSE,0,t3_3g72ar,"I'm from Australia where we grow up with cricket rather than baseball. The fundamentals are the same: a pitcher throws a ball at a batter, who hits the ball between fielders and then runs to a goal to score points.

But cricket is superior to baseball in every way. The fielders don't wear gloves. They cover more ground. The batter is allowed and encouraged to hit the ball in a 360 radius from where he stands, compared to 90 degrees in baseball. The field is far more customisable, making allowances for left-handed batsmen and bowlers (pitchers), the bowler himself, the weather conditions, the shape and size of the ground itself, the state of the match. Baseball field positions are more or less static. With the exception of an occasional bunt in baseball, it is more or less all out attack, whereas cricket teams must make constant adjustments to their strategy. Often cricket teams won't even try to get a batter out. 

The area at which a baseball pitcher must aim is extremely small, limiting the number of ways the batter can deal with a ball in the 'strike zone.' Conversely cricket bowlers can and do aim at a batman's body in order to intimidate them, or pitch the ball in other areas in order to entice them to play risky shots that are likely result in an out. That is to say, the rules of cricket allow for players to have a much wider spectrum of playing styles than baseball does.

Innings are longer in cricket which allows 'relationships' to develop between batters, and tactical battles to evolve between opposing batters and bowlers. In baseball a pitcher and batter will only face each other for a theoretical maximum of 54 pitches per game (the reality is far, far less than this), whereas it is common in cricket for one batsman to face one bowler for hundreds of deliveries (pitches) per game. Cricket batsmen can choose whether to run or not, which requires a whole extra layer of strategy from both teams.

There is more. Cricket is to baseball as chess is to checkers. What does baseball have over cricket?

1331,CMV: Everyone should drive an AWD,FALSE,0,t3_375u5c,"Pretty simple view, I see no reason why everyone shouldn't drive an all wheel drive vehicle day to day. Slight biases: I have a 1991 Subaru Legacy as my daily driver, have driven many different new vehicles in the past year, and I drive for 10 hours a day so I see a lot of things on the road.

The increase in traction provided by an AWD is immesurably valuable. Driving in the rain constantly, hitting black ice, and on rare occasion driving in snow, under no normal driving circumstances has my car come close to losing control. My tires, even when bald, have refused to spin, except under an excessive ammount of throttle while on wet pavement. No RWD I've driven has come close to maintaining as much control in any circumstance as my AWD, running on technology 20+ years older.

The only cons I see are lower gas milage and increased cost, but do not believe these are significant enough to negate the benefits.

1398,CMV: Amtrak should receive much higher levels of funding than they do now.,FALSE,0,t3_36fy31,"Unfortunately, the only time Amtrak specifically and passenger rail generally become a part of public discussion seems to be when something goes wrong. Most of you are probably aware that something did go wrong last week, when Amtrak's Northeast Regional #188 derailed in Pennsylvania. This CMV is not about that incident, however.

I have long held the view that the passenger rail should, and inevitably will, become a much larger part of our national transportation mix. I've yet to hear a thoughtful, legitimate argument against greater investment in passenger rail, specifically Amtrak. Most people who oppose Amtrak, particularly in Congress, seem to be doing so based on ideological or political reasons. For example, the last Chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee has called Amtrak a ""Soviet style railroad"". Most criticisms of Amtrak I've heard are similarly based in ideological beliefs. 

Now, I will try to briefly summarize some of the key reasons I've long thought Amtrak should be a top priority for investment and expanded funding.

* Critics of Amtrak often point to the fact that it is a money losing operation, and is consequently subsidized by taxpayer money. This is perhaps the most common complaint from some (not all) Republicans. The way I see it, all modes of transportation are heavily subsidized, and Amtrak should not be singled out for losing money. All railroads, public and private, are responsible for all of their infrastructure. That means every inch of rail, every freight terminal and passenger station, every locomotive and car, their traffic management systems, and even their own police departments. By contrast, we (the taxpayer) fund the construction and maintenance of airports and highways. We pay for the FAA, which manages private airline traffic. We pay for the TSA, which provides security for the airlines. We pay for traffic officers in police departments. The bankrupt Highway Trust Fund, paid for by the federal gas tax, no longer covers all of its costs. Consequently, Congress has bailed it out with short term extensions for more than eight years now. According to Amtrak's CEO, Joe Boardman, these ""bailouts"" have added up to more than Amtrak's entire operating subsidy since its inception in 1975. So, with all this in mind, it seems ridiculous to single out passenger rail as the only transportation mode that needs to be profitable and should not be subsidized. We subsidize all modes, and all lose money, why should Amtrak be the one exception?

* Even if Amtrak was as burdensome on taxpayers as some politicians and pundits suggest, there seems to be a strong public interest in expanding passenger rail. Unlike road and air competition, even if you personally do not use Amtrak, you benefit from higher Amtrak ridership. According to the Brookings Institute, Amtrak is now the fastest growing method of transportation. Its broken its ridership records nearly every year for the past 12 years, with the Northeast Corridor (NEC) in particular booming since the introduction of the Acela. Amtrak controls more than 75% of all air-rail traffic in the Northeast, which benefits air and road travelers as well. Less traffic on our already congested highways, less traffic in our airports, less pollution in our air, and downward pressure on the demand for oil are all secondary effects that benefit people who do not use Amtrak.

* If lowering our dependence on foreign oil via decreased demand and if global warming is a concern for you as it is for me, then prioritizing rail over air and road transportation seems to be a necessity. Trains are masters of efficiency in a way that even the most fuel efficient jet and greenest hybrid are not. According to the Department of Transportation's Bureau of Transportation Statistics, in 2012 Amtrak's energy intensity per passenger mile sat at 1,561 British thermal units. By contrast, the average domestic airline service uses 2,477 BTUs per passenger mile. For some reason, 2006 is the last available data on passenger cars, and they used 2,898 BTUs and light trucks used 5,465 BTUs per passenger mile. Even private freight carriers are extremely efficient. According to FreightRailWorks.com, the average train can move one ton of freight 475 miles on one gallon of fuel. These facts suggest to me that the future lies in rail, not road, and that further Amtrak expansion could help lower our national energy consumption and transportation related pollution.

So Change My View! Like I said, most arguments against Amtrak seem overly politicized. So I'm interested to hear any cogent argument opposing passenger rail investment generally or Amtrak specifically. I suppose the latter is likely easier to make than the former, because it could be possible to support passenger rail investment but oppose Amtrak as an entity. If this is your argument, I would be interested in hearing what alternatives to a federally subsidized passenger rail corporation are out there.

309,CMV: A Trump/Kasich ticket is the Republican party's best chance at the 2016 presidency,FALSE,0,t3_3gabsk,"Donald Trump refused to rule out a third party run in the first debate, and he obviously has the bankroll to make that happen without having to beg for money like the rest of the candidates.

This means that if the GOP don't nominate Trump, he will very likely spoil the election for them by drawing away GOP votes to an independent ticket. Even without that dynamic, it would have already been a very tough electoral race for the GOP.

So unless they nominate Trump, the GOP will definitely lose the 2016 presidential race.

If Trump does get the nomination, he could max out his electability by picking John Kasich, who is the least offensive Republican to moderates and liberals and who is also popular in Ohio, a key swing state.

That would show that Trump can make smart political decisions, which could further sway independents and moderates who are tired of establishment politics.

What's happening right now is that the GOP establishment does not like having a candidate who is not in their pocket, so they are trying to sink Trump's candidacy in favor of Jeb Bush (or maybe Rubio), who will also pick John Kasich as his running mate.

But Jeb's candidacy would be sunk not only by it being George W. Bush's brother running, but also by Trump's running and the electoral map favoring Democrats.  A Rubio/Kasich ticket or Jeb/Rubio ticket would be sunk for similar reasons.

So Donald Trump is actually the most electable Republican presidential candidate, and a Trump/Kasich ticket is the most electable Republican ticket. 

(Maybe a Trump/Floridian ticket would do as well, but it probably wouldn't be their best chance.)

1387,"CMV: Primates are non-human persons, and we should no sooner perform invasive experiments on them than we would a human who cannot give their informed assent.",FALSE,0,t3_36j8wx,"Basically what it says in the title. I've spent enough time around primates--specifically bonobo apes--to believe that, while they might not have all the capabilities of a human, they are ""nearly human,"" i.e. they have brains that are ballpark like ours, and I can't say for sure their lives lack the kind of meaning I find in my own--the meaning that makes life worth preserving. If we agree that it's unethical to experiment on incapacitated humans (mentally handicapped, comatose, etc.), then we shouldn't be allowed to experiment on primates.

I'm not a vegetarian, nor am I an animal-rights activist. I'm agnostic about the degree to which many animals can think, feel, imagine, and suffer, but the capacity for primates to do all of the above is--to me, obviously--uncomfortably close to our own, and, as such, they deserve the same sort of autonomy we consider to be among the ""inalienable rights of man"". Here is a mild, but more informed, [take](http://animalresearch.thehastingscenter.org/report/the-case-for-phasing-out-experiments-on-primates/) on this issue. (You can also google ""non-human personhood"" for more.) It's not without repercussions for many areas of medicine such as HIV research, but I think that infecting an ape with HIV is not much different from infecting a person who cannot speak or think at an adult level. It's a case of protecting ""the least of us,"" even as it makes important work like [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/36hq9i/potential_new_vaccine_blocks_every_strain_of_hiv/) more difficult.

1171,CMV: faith is a force for evil in the world,FALSE,0,t3_3903zk,"For the sake of discussion I will be referring to this definition of faith. 

Faith: firm belief in something for which there is no proof

or in simpler language

Claiming to know something without evidence or proof.

I am modifying the definition to make clear that while there may or may not be evidence for something, it is not about there not being evidence, it is about you not having it when claiming to know something. 

Evil will, for the purposes of clarity, be something which diminishes wellbeing. Good would be something which promotes wellbeing. 

In a wide variety of different areas we can see different ideas playing out, with many different views in direct competition. Religions make claims about the universe they cannot back up, scientists don't know all the answers to everything but are conservative in stating what they do know. Homeopaths claim their magic water has a memory and can fix any issue, but can't show it to be true. Chiropractors claim that the spine becomes misaligned through subluxations and this inhibits the flow of the vital force, causing illness, yet when asked to show a subluxation they can't show anything, and more interestingly conflict with each other. Acupuncturists claim that points on the body correspond with other places, and that piercing a point with a needle they can create theraputic results, but they can't even agree on which points to use. Terrorists, politicians, homo economis economists, and so on.

All of these groups use faith as their primary epistemology and therefore are immune from correction. When you use faith as your method for knowing about the world you can never get closer to the truth and therefore become opposed to someone out there. 

I think this leads to much if the conflict we see in the world. 

So, my contention is as follows. Faith, claiming to know something you don't have evidence for, is a force for evil, and therefore degrades human wellbeing. ",1171,TRUE,,FALSE,0
51,CMV: Being a whore/slut is not a bad thing,FALSE,0,t3_3ipco6,"Before I begin, I would like to clarify that my definition of the word whore/slut/tramp and the like when I was growing up meant a Woman/Girl who had a lot of sexual partners, (not the other definition, which means to have sex for money) and this is the definition I will be discussing here today.

A person's view of what sex is and how it should be done is different for everyone. Some see it as just a casual thing, others a sacred act. But in the end, I doubt anyone would dispute the claim that a desire for sex is one of the most natural things about being human, secondary only to wanting food/water/shelter, and on equal standing to a desire for life fulfillment and companionship.

So why then, is having sex with a lot of people viewed as bad? Especially when you're taking the proper measures to make sure both you and your partner are safe, and you are not going to produce an unwanted baby....

Women in particular are the ones who get this sorta flack the most. It's very easy yet also extremely nasty to call a fellow girl a whore/slut/tramp etc when you want to discredit her. It's implied that a woman is somehow dirty or is a low life or what have you simply because she chooses to have a lot of sex.

But what happens when a guy has a lot of sex? He get's applauded for it. It's seen as him ""just doing what guys do."" It's almost like it is encouraged. Even gay guys like myself don't get flack for having a lot of casual sex (we get shit for a totally different reason lmfao) but generally our straight allies don't tend to question our behavior all that much. At least, from my experience..

So why is it bad for a girl to have a lot of sex? I get that girls sexual ""wiring"" is different from guys as they generally leads to them having different/lower sex drives. But when a girl DOES have a high sex drive, and doesn't want a relationship, WHY IS THAT BAD?

Footnote: Any girls out there reading this who like having lots of sex GOOD FOR YOU MAN. I support you.

729,"CMV: ""equal rights, equal lefts"" isn't about equality, it's about violence",TRUE,1,t3_3cxe4b,"A common meme among MRAs and the ""pussy pass"" crowd is that whenever a woman hits a man in some way and then gets hit back, it's ""equality"" in action because society sees violence against women as more important than violence against men.  

A shorthand catch phrase that expresses this is ""equal rights, equal lefts"" which implies that if women want to be treated equally they should expect to be hit back if they hit someone else.  

I disagree that this is about equality at all.  

1) Overwhelmingly, in cases where this concept is used on reddit, the man used disproportionate violence. See this thread for an example: https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/3chyco/fsu_quarterback_is_filmed_punching_a_woman_in_the/  

Most of the upvoted comments in the linked /r/news thread stated she had it coming and that it was equality for her to be hit. But if you actually watch the video she hardly posed a threat to him, and all she did was weakly hit him. Then he lobbed a punch that knocked her flat  

2) The stronger/larger person should show self restraint. Many of the same people who argue in favor of this phrase are also the same people who constantly argue about the physical differences between men and women. Is it not then hypocritical to expect fair fights?   

3) I think all you need to do is check out how much people revel in women ""getting their comeuppance"" in these fight videos to see that they enjoy watching women get beat as if they always expect not to get hit back (ie. ""using their pussy pass"") when in fact I've rarely if ever seen videos where women are shown saying or expecting that.

edit: since a lot of this discussion has centered around self-defense, I would like to link [this Sam Harris article](http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/the-truth-about-violence) on de-escalating violence. I don't think we should be celebrating fights that start from *either party* escalating it further  

edit 2: Not sure if this is relevant, but what brought this up is this: My concern is that whenever I see those kinds of comments, people claim that they're just interested in equality. But that doesn't sound right to me because of how 1) the fight is usually so one-sided, 2) you usually can't even show that the woman was using her ""pussy pass"", 3) I don't see much evidence that women by and large even think they can get away with violence because of their gender

638,CMV: Reductions in CO2/Climate Change are never going to happen by reducing energy consumption.,FALSE,0,t3_3dqhdc,"All of the focus on combating climate change is ways to reduce energy consumption, alternate technology, and producing fewer tons of CO2. It think this is unrealistic that with a growing population, many countries in their industrial revolution and increasing standards of living we will never reduce our energy demands. The level of reduction to actually reduce climate change is substantial and even the most optimistic predictions about energy reduction would come close. Reducing energy consumption/increasing energy costs hurts people's standards of living and especially in developing countries where they are already so poor. I think it is realistic to think that a technology can be developed that scrubs the CO2 from the atmosphere and we can control the level of CO2 in the atmosphere to the ideal level. 

Tell me how we can really reduce out CO2 to a level that actually reverses climate change without a new technology that scrubs CO2 from the atmosphere.

1227,CMV: Police officers not shaking hands with people is a dick move and is part of the reason public perceptions of officers are so negative.,TRUE,1,t3_38af51,"Police officers not shaking hands with people is a dick move and is part of the reason public perceptions of officers are so negative. It serves to reenforce an ""Us vs. Them"" mentality. The main reason for not shaking hands with the public is safety, as it would put the officer in a vulnerable situation. However, is that not the point of a handshake? Offering you empty hand to a stranger shows trust and a mutual respect. Soldiers shake hands with civilians for this very reason. If an officer is so bad at threat assessment they will not shake hands with anyone who is not an officer, they should find a different job.

108,"CMV: Divorce, no matter the kind, shouldn't punish anyone, and no one should be forced to pay the other being.",TRUE,1,t3_3i3vx9,"Before I begin, I would like to point something out. I assume that this is bound to be brought up, so I will answer this first. ""That means that marriage isn't as special and you can just drop out freely whenever you want"". I don't see this as a viable argument, because if someone is going to leave, then they have a reason to. Even if its a bad reason, or a really good reason, making the person stay by the threat of losing lots of money and/or possessions will only make the marriage worse and worse and cause the couple to fight more and more. 

I see no reason whatsoever why anyone should be able to take legal action if their spouse decides to leave then. If someone leaves a marriage, it means they are unhappy with it, or have lost feelings for the other person. And like I said in my first statement, making the person stay in marriage until a joint divorce is (if ever) made by the threat of the person leaving losing a lot of money and/or possessions will only make the marriage worse and worse, leaving 1 or both of the people suffering for years. 

Another reason why this is bad is if one person is unhappy in their marriage, and the spouse is forcing them to stay by means of threatening legal action, will leave the unhappy spouse in a terrible marriage for years, or possibly for the rest of their lives.

421,CMV: welfare depresses wages for low skilled workers,FALSE,0,t3_3fei08,"This is an idea I just thought of and it seems possible so I've brought it to you guys to be challenged. 

Many people's current salary are totally insufficient to pay for both housing and food for their family. In addition to this all workers must spend money on transportation and health care.

Imagine that there was no welfare. What would happen? Well, workers would find themselves with some combination of homelessness, malnutrition, rapidly deteriorating health, or inability to get to work.

How could a business that relies on low wage workers sustain itself with a workforce in this condition? Walmart and McDonalds cannot have a workforce that is terribly stinky because of homelessness, or passing out and performing poorly due to malnutrition. They cannot have a workforce who cannot even show up to work en masse. 

In the absence of welfare companies would have to pay more wages to have a functioning workforce.

1291,CMV: To push the other person off the bridge is the correct solution to the trolley problem.,TRUE,1,t3_37nxjn,"For those who don't know, the trolley problem is this:

You and another person are on a bridge which is over a trolley track. 5 people are tied to the track, and the trolley is coming. You may either push the other person off the bridge, which will stop the trolley before it hits the 5 people, which will kill that person, or you can do nothing, which will kill the 5 people. I add the rule that the trolley will not stop if it hits you, and will only stop if it hits the person with you, which eliminates the ""I'll jump myself"" answer and keeps the idea of the scenario in place.

I believe that the proper solution is to push the person off the bridge. The purpose of the problem is to present a dilemma between utilitarianism (benefitting the most people in the best way) and deontology (doing one's duty in life as in following basic principles), but I do not believe that doing nothing and allowing the 5 people to die is ethical under either mindset. By neglecting to push the other person off the bridge, you have prioritized your own moral standpoint over the lives of not just one, but 5 other people. The idea that one should not kill may be generally applicable, but to effectively condemn other people to die because you do not want to compromise your morals is incredibly selfish, and goes against the implied deontological principle that one should prioritize the needs of others over one's own (especially if one's needs are really wants). In general, I believe that a failure to take a potentially immoral action to prevent an injustice due to the action being potentially immoral is selfish and unjustifiable. CMV!

464,"CMV: The Kurds are the good guys, and western nations should be engaging in a hands-down alliance with them in the Middle East.",TRUE,1,t3_3f2sbt,"I am a cynical man.  I don't believe in heroes, and so I'm prepared to change my view on this.  THe trouble is, every last bit of news I hear about the current Middle East conflicts goes only to reinforce my ever-growing belief that the Kurds are the only group involved with any moral high ground.

1) The Kurds espouse a number of western values that are largely absent in the region.

Only The Kurds and the (middle and lower class) Iranians show any tendency to respect women's rights or treat them as equals deserving of respect or status.  The Kurds have women in their military, and even their conservative tribal organizations can have Matriarchs in charge of political and military decisions.

2) They care about more than just themselves.

The Kurds have gone out of their way, at significant danger to themselves, to rescue other ethnic minorities in the region, including famously the Yazidis, who everyone else was more than happy to let ISIS literally murder, enslave, and rape at genocidal scales.

3) Their political opponents have all shown themselves to be monsters in the fullness of time.

Turkey is key here.  For a while Turkey managed to keep up quite a reputation as a modern secular-Islamic state.  Now they're wringing their hands about how *powerless* they are to stop ISIS while they gleefully watch the black banner do all their dirty work for them, then step in with overwhelming force to rescue Ataturk's grave the moment it's threatened.  They're bombing Kurdish targets *right now* while crying about ISIS.  I would want independence from them too.

**Things that will not convince me:**

1) A Kurd did something bad once.

Every group consists of a bulk center and extremes on either end.  It takes a pattern of ideological violence to establish that a group is responsible collectively.  I need to be shown that the Kurds, as a national or cultural entity, are at least half as bad as their neighbors in terms of the actions they will routinely, officially, or systemically commit or tolerate.

2) It is advantageous to ally ourselves with monsters.

Look, you can be totally right about this.  I won't even argue that this isn't possible, and might even agree with you, but it does not change my view about what we, the west, *should* be doing.


Make me a cynic again, please.

460,"CMV: ""open"" and ""equal"" debate is not the right way to combat ignorance and hate",FALSE,0,t3_3f3jk9,"This morning, the admin /u/spez made a post giving the reason why they're not banning /r/coontown. Here's his posts:  

&gt;[While my personal views towards bigotry haven't changed, my opinion of what Reddit should do about it has. I don't think we should silence people just because their viewpoints are something we disagree with. There is value in the conversation, and we as a society need to confront these issues. This is an incredibly complex topic, and I'm sure our thinking will continue to evolve.](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3f10up/good_morning_i_thought_id_give_a_quick_update/ctka48v?context=3)

#  

&gt;[Horrible, actually, but I don't think you can win an argument by simply silencing the opposition.](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3f10up/good_morning_i_thought_id_give_a_quick_update/ctk9uk0?context=3)  

---  

Many people in that thread agree with /u/spez there. That to fight racism, we need to *debate* racism *with* the racists. I think this line of thinking is naive, and simply wrong, for these reasons:  

1) There is mountains of scientific evidence that climate change exists (and is a result of human activities) and there is also mountains of evidence of the efficacy of vaccines. No serious, respected group of scientists deny this. Yet, the way the media has addressed these topics (which is to give ""both sides"" of the ""debate"" an equal platform/time) has *not* resulted in these positions declining in belief among the general public. [The BBC has just recognized this](http://www.salon.com/2014/07/06/bbc_staff_ordered_to_stop_giving_equal_air_time_to_climate_deniers/), a bit late though. The anti-vaxxer movement is going strong, and has grown thanks to many ""debates"" being put on air. There are *politicians in the U.S. Congress* who don't believe in climate change. Open debate does not help to weed out such positions, clearly. 

2) While I can't say how effective ""silencing the opposition"" is, I disagree with the idea what ""not giving them a platform"" is the same thing as silencing. Nobody is stopping them from shouting what they have to say over the Internet in their blogs and websites. What shouldn't happen is pretending giving them the respect of an open debate and claiming that both sides have merit. You wouldn't bring on a KKK member to argue with a civil rights activist on TV, why should reddit?

3) reddit as a platform itself is very ill-suited to the style of ""open debate"" that /u/spez and his supporters claim will be enough to weed out the racism in society. The upvote/downvote system and the userbase's affinity for liking long arguments that sound logical and scientific is perfect fodder for the white supremacist's style of argumentation, which is basically a Gish Gallop. You inundate your opponent with a bunch of links and cherry-picked facts to *strongly suggest but never outright state* a conclusion (that black people are inferior) which leaves you a lot of lee-way with claiming victory over your debate opponent. Plus, the general disdain for any explanation that deals with ""SJW"" terms and explanations makes it harder for anyone to side with you. The white supremacists come to the debate with the intention to *win* an argument, *not* to debate. So unless you're equally as prepared with your own walls-of-text copypasted, you'll lose unless you have the hours (and the brigade of supporters) to deal with them.

4) As an addendum to #1 and #3, given how the issue of race and biology, sociology, etc. are still not nearly as understood as how vaccines are necessary and how climate change is happening, giving them an equal platform gives them an even better shot than the anti-vaxxers and climate change deniers in converting people to their ideology. Dylann Storm Roof became a racist after he looked into intentionally misleading copypasta of black crime statistics posted by the Council of Conservative Citizens. And you can see where that led him.

I think for these reasons that /u/spez's reason for not banning a place like /r/coontown is naive and possibly dangerous.  

---  

That being said, I'm not exactly sure *what* the right way to combat ignorance and hate is. Better education in our public schools would probably be a good first step.  

Alternatively, we could follow the example in the story of [the Racist Tree](http://lardcave.net/text/the_racist_tree.html).

1301,CMV: Liberland already failed to be libertarian,FALSE,0,t3_37i3oi,"**Background:** Liberland is a new, self-declared micronation located on the banks of the Danube River, between Serbia and Croatia. Neither country claims the land for itself. In April 2015, a Czech libertarian activist claimed the land under a new country named Liberland, which aspires to be the first nation governed by  Libertarian principles.

**The Problems:** First, by claiming a new country and giving out the land, the movement may be infringing on property rights of those who already have claim. A journalist found an old house there during a visit, so someone owned the property at some point, and may have descendants who have legal claim to the land. Second, the president of the country already put quotas and restrictions in place to limit the size and make-up of the population. Only a few thousand people will be allowed to live there, and people with criminal records or certain political affiliations are barred from living there. This second point sounds incredibly hypocritical for a nation based on the ideas of freedom and liberty.

I could be wrong, so if there are any libertarians out there who support Liberland and can change my view, please do.

I also don't think it is strictly the language being used. Regardless of the label, not wanting your partner to have been with 5+ people is 100% defensible. If we, as a society, can tell people that being tall is attractive or that being fat is unattractive, we can tell being that sleeping around is unattractive.     

Another logically invalid argument is that the person with the preference, must not be promiscuous themselves. I think this is as non-nonsensical as telling a man he can only be attracted to men, otherwise he's hypocritical. My choice in partner is independent of my partner's choice in me, we can like different things. Many physically fit men are ""chubby-chasers"" and man slutty men are virginal chasers. 


Edit: To clarify, the use of the words ""slut"" earlier was merely a reflection of the term as it has been used on Reddit. I do not view a persons' worth as tied to their sexual history. I also don't have an moral qualms towards premarital sex or number of sexual partners. That said, my personal level of attraction is affected.

It seems that people often don't realize capitalism was never meant to include everybody, that unemployed people do generate a lot of GDP since they consume, and that most of the time science and technology is to be thanked, instead of ""hard work"".

It's easy to be a cynic and argue that overpopulation is a problem, that ""trimming the fat"" should be made more regularly, but the truth is, nobody really understand what motivates individuals to work, get involved in society and it seems society is completely unable to tolerate marginal people. Social stratification and social Darwinism are plaguing society. Everybody wants to go up, and nobody dares looking down.

So instead of blaming the unemployed, use other means to solve this problem: start a business, hire unemployed people, ask for a raise, quit your job and join the unemployed to better understand what civilization is about: it's about living together. Capitalism is a mean, not an end. Stop living in your bubble and learn to know the struggles of others.

846,CMV: Religion is the only thing in the Universe that objectively compels us to live for something other than ourselves,TRUE,1,t3_3bxlje,"*tl;dr* - **Nature dictates  that the strong survive and the weak perish. Those with power will do and those without power will not. Human beings are naturally selfish and self serving creatures even through our acts of love and kindness. Due to these 2 facts, there is nothing in this world that compels us to live for another human being other than the threats of punishments and promises of rewards religion brings.**

I've broken my argument down into 4 parts and a final part to make it more digestible.

**Part I: The Law of the Land**

Right and wrong are man made concepts that apply only to humans. No other creature on earth follows rules of morality and ethics other than human beings. Nature dictates that the strong will survive and the weak will perish. Who tells a lion it is wrong to slaughter a gazelle for food when it can just as easily find plant life to eat? Imagine if cows and chickens could talk. Imagine one of them walking up to you and saying ""Human, I have feelings and emotions. You capture and breed my kind as livestock and reduced our existence to the mere purpose of providing you food. We have hopes and dreams and aspirations. We do not want to die"". You, like myself and like the lion would reply ""HAHAHA I eat you because I have the power to and you do not have the power to stop me. I have been equipped to exert my dominance over you and will do so because such is the law of the land"" and you would have every right to say so. If you have the power to do so, whatever it is, then it is in your right. Morals and ethics are immaterial, there are only absolutes (strength, speed, intelligence). This is the world we live in. 

**Part II &amp; III: The Nature of the Human Psyche &amp; The Mysteries of Love**

I am not religious nor do I believe in a god but I am a visionary. I often thought of how to create a ""perfect"" society free of corruption and greed. No matter how much I contemplated on how such a society could be formed, I always arrived to the same conclusion: perfect societies are impossible because of human self interest. The most basic instinct in every living creature is survival. Every living creature on earth seeks to increase its own utility (content, happiness) through primary needs such as food, water and shelter but also through secondary needs such as entertainment, love, and companionship. Our entire existence is a goal to acquire those needs and serve our self interests. Greed will always exist because it is in our best self interest to be greedy. Corruption, cheating, stealing, lying - we do all of these things because they serve us. They work to achieve our desires and fulfill our self interests. 


Right now you're probably saying something like ""well then how do you explain the love we have for other people"". Understanding ""love"" is a mystery unto itself that I can't fully explain but I can say that for the most part, it still functions (for the most part) under self interest. The love we show our close family and friends is a result of having familiarity (and I would even go far as to say a sense of belonging/ownership) to them. MY son, MY daughter, MY mom, MY dad, MY friend, my my my....We typically don't develop love for other people until they have a stake in OUR lives. Whether you find them funny or charming or simply and inherent love that comes with coming from the same bloodline, we appreciate them for the joy they bring into our lives. Next you might say what about the compassion and kindness we show strangers less fortunate then ourselves such as the homeless people downtown or starving children in Africa. To that I ask you can anyone truly appreciate the pain of others without ever experiencing it or having the ability to sympathize with it first themselves (empathy)? Without familiarity to one's suffering on at least a basic level, I believe it is impossible to truly care for that person's well being. Think about it, when you give a homeless man $10 to buy lunch that day, you're doing it because you understand the pain of going hungry. Had you never experienced hunger or at least been able to empathize with his feeling of hunger, you almost certainly would not care for that individual's problems because you simply cannot relate to them. It is not until you can put yourself (literally, psychologically, or emotionally) into someone's situation that you feel compelled to make a change in that persons life. So I will repeat myself when I say everything we do is dictated by self interest, even the love and kindness we show others. I cannot think of one thing human beings are known to do that does not give us some kind of emotional, psychological or literal satisfaction.

Whether they are from a different race, sex, religion, or culture, we fail to empathize with those who we view as different than ourselves and cannot place ourselves in their situation. Most genocides are typically predated by a period of propaganda used to besmirch the victimized group and dehumanize them from the people who commit the act. The German people didn't let the Nazi power commit their terrible acts because Germans are inherently evil, they did so because they were brainwashed not to identify with Jews as fellow human beings but as trash that needed to be exterminated. Everything we do is dictated by the self interest we hold in ourselves. 

**Part IV: An Inconvenient truth**

And this brings us to the crux of my argument. When you live in a world where the only thing stopping you from doing as you please are your own capabilities and your main drive for living is serving your own self interests, what use is there to care for other living creatures? What compels us to help those less fortunate than ourselves other than the satisfaction we get from knowing we did something ""good""? What is there in the world to compel us to live for someone other than oneself? You guessed it: religion. The only thing that objectively compels us to live for other human beings are the punishment and rewards religion brings. The only thing that truly compels humanity to care for others is knowing that if you don't, an infinitely more powerful being than yourself will punish you for it. There is no subjectivity here: either you do it and get rewarded or don't and pay. Even if you hate the person you are helping and cannot empathize with them whatsoever, you do it because it is in your own self interest. I have literally met people who have said they help others not because they want to necessarily but God wants them to. I will use Judaeo-Christianity as an example because it is the religion I am most familiar with. As awful as some of the messages in the Bible are, there are some good virtues in them as well such as helping those less fortunate and embracing your fellow man with love and kindness. The problem with this is most of us don't care about helping people we don't know and very very few of us would go out of our way to do so simply out of personal satisfaction. Without the threat and rewards religions bring, there is nothing compelling us to live for our fellow man.


**Part Finale: Common Counter Arguments:**

**But you even said yourself religion is motivated through self interest. Aren't there also scenarios where showing other human beings kindness serve our self interests and compel us to live for our fellow man?**

No. Showing kindess does not compel us to live for our fellow man because there is always the use of force. Remember the law of the land: Those with power will do and those without power will not. I cannot think of a single scenario where the use of kindness cannot be substituted for the use of force.

**Religion does not compel us to do anything because you don't have to believe in a god**

I'm not saying everyone has to believe in a god or that identifying with a religion automatically compels you to live for other people. I'm saying those who truly do believe in the existence of a heaven and hell and truly do hold the values of their religion are compelled and those who do not believe have nothing in this world to compel them to. 

My rant is officially over. Now someone change my view.

1402,"CMV: Turning right on red from the ""outside lane"" or ""left right turn lane"" should be legal in most cases.",TRUE,1,t3_36fllr,"As can be seen in [this image](http://mediaassets.naplesnews.com/photo/2014/05/20/0716_NCLO_Know1_4963231_ver1.0_640_480.JPG), in most places in the U.S. (and maybe elsewhere that right-on-red is allowed?), it is legal to turn right on red from the inmost lane, but if there is more than one right-only turn lane, all others are prohibited from turning right on red.


I do not see why this is.  If it is legal to turn right on red after checking for incoming traffic from your left in one lane, why would it not be in another?  I don't think there is a significant likelihood of cars from more than one turn lane crashing into each other.

I also don't think it likely that a vehicle turning right on red from the leftmost right turn lane would be more likely to collide with oncoming traffic.  Surely he would check both lanes of traffic before turning, just as the inside lane would check the rightmost incoming traffic lane as well as whether there is anyone that might be changing lanes into his lane before the intersection.

However, I imagine that someone somewhere had a reason for making this a law, so I am quite willing to change my view if given reasoning as to why turning right on red from anything but the inside lane is predominantly illegal.

Edit: going to bed. I posted this on a whim and didn't think about the time required for a detailed discussion. Thanks for the comments. I'll respond more tomorrow.

248,CMV: Only cisgender exists,FALSE,0,t3_3gs0zf,"I'd like to start this by clearly defining my position:

I think only cisgender, and by that I mean identifying with the gender you are born with, is a valid gender identification. I don't know if valid is the right world but it's the only one that sounds appropriate. Essentially, I think gender and biological sex are one and the same, gender is just a social construct to express our biological sex.


In every animal in nature we can find two sexes, male and female. Sometimes the sexes have similar roles, sometimes the male or the female has more important roles, it doesn't matter - It's there, and it's happening in nature. I'm not making an appeal to nature as a form of fallacy, I'm merely pointing out that it's a special pleading fallacy to think humans are special because we can get away with ignoring our biological sex. I admit that Humans have less sexual dimorphism than other animals and namely we can find, aside from physical and procreation capacities, little differences between men and women because both are capable of amazing things. I'm ok with abolishing or ignoring gender roles and allowing boys and girls to play with what they want. What we can't do is to pretend that we can magically change the sex we are born into.

To use an analogy, if I decided to transplant my nose and put some whiskers and called myself a tiger, would I be a tiger or just a nutjob? What would you consider me?

The primary argument for transgenderism is that gender dysphoria makes people feel bad about the biological sex they are born with or the gender they were assigned at birth, and therefore they have the right to identify with what makes them more comfortable. This sounds nice and reasonable, but the issue is that thinking we are something does not make us that something. I can imagine I'm a dragon in my head but that doesn't change the fact dragons don't exist and I'm still Human.

To categorize and simplify arguments:

1 - Every or most species have a male and female specimen and, regardless of what roles each one has, to think Humans are different is a special pleading, kinda like thinking Humans will forever be the best species on the universe

2 - The fact someone's brain tells them something is wrong or better doesn't mean it's true. If your brain can identify as a genderqueer or genderneutral, I don't see how I can't identify as a rock or a dragon. Why is the latter less valid? The fact the brain identifies as such doesn't mean we are such, it's irrelevant. If you are born with a penis, you are a man and if you are born with a vagina, you are a woman. There are obvious biological features specially related to procreation and body shape. Some transgender people, even those who have surgery, will forever look similar to the gender they don't want to be associated it, it's inevitable. The fact I want to change my deepest self doesn't mean I am actually doing it.

3 - Why is gender special? In short, why can't I magically change other things about myself? I look white, and I know race is a social construct - It's still a useful concept to categorize us - Why can't I identify as black even with pale skin? Why can't a redhead identify as a black hair? Why can't children identify as adults, etc.? Again, special pleading.


Oh, I also think the word cisgender shouldn't even be used.

Some notes:
- I am not promoting violence and hate against transgender people. If I meet someone who is trans, I will treat them like I treat anyone else. I can disagree with the core idea without hating the person.
- Don't bring up analogies to gay people and gay marriage because both are incomparable and completely different topics.
- Don't use ""you're a bigot"" as an argument
- My arguments have nothing to do with religion, I'm an atheist.",248,TRUE,,FALSE,0
1369,CMV: It is impossible to be a true Christian and support the actions of the United States.,TRUE,1,t3_36olkz,"First I think I should make all the clarifications I can.  By ""true Christian,"" I mean someone that does their absolute best to live by the teachings of Jesus Christ.  A ""true Christian"" actively analyzes his or her own behavior and actively attempts to better themselves based on Jesus's teachings.  And by ""behavior,"" I specifically refer to relationships with others, social interactions, lifestyle, and actions over words. 

By ""support the United States,""  I want to refer specifically to U.S. foreign policy and action, specifically the current/recent wars in the middle east.  Also think about matters such as:

-support of the state of Israel (not condeming it's terrible actions) 

-CIA/blackops/paramilitary operations around the world

-backing of dictators and tyrants because they do the bidding of corporate interests

-use of torture

-use of drone strikes





I was raised as a Christian (ECLA Lutheran) and although I am now an agnostic, the moral teachings of Jesus and Christianity have not left me.  Here is my understanding of Christianity and the teachings of Jesus, and I will also say that every civil, intelligent conversation I have had about religion has ended with these same conclusions:

-Everyone should try their very best to follow the golden rule, the second commandment, or whatever you want to call it:  ""Love thy neighbor as thyself,""  ""treat others how you want to be treated,"" etc.  It's a pretty universal moral code amongst humanity, but is specifically important to Christianity

-People are not perfect.  They commit sins.  But if you try to live your life to the best of your ability following the golden rule, to care for and love others as yourself, and confess your sins to be forgiven by Jesus/God, then you will be saved.  You can get into all the ins and outs of the ""resurrection,"" but when it comes down to it, the sacrifice and resurrection of Jesus is to forgive the sins of those who attempt to live good lives and sincerely admit/confess their sins.  If you don't actually mean it and feel remorse, it's meaningless.

-God is love, submit yourself to the will of God, humble yourself before God, you are nothing compared to God, love God with all of your heart, etc.

Here are some relevant Jesus quotes:

""A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another.""

""But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven; for he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.""

""For what shall it profit a man, if he gain the whole world, and suffer the loss of his soul?""

""If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them. And if you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same.""

""I tell you the truth, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.""

""For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and everyone who humbles himself will be exalted.""

""Give to everyone who begs from you; and of him who takes away your goods do not ask them again. And as you wish that men would do to you, do so to them.""

""All the commandments: You shall not commit adultery, you shall not kill, you shall not steal, you shall not covet, and so on, are summed up in this single command: You must love your neighbor as yourself.""

""For if you love those who love you, what reward have you? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?""

Now the main reason why I disaffiliated myself from Christianity can be best described by a quote of Gandhi: “I like your Christ, I do not like your Christians. Your Christians are so unlike your Christ.”  That and I realized there is a high probability that Jesus did not actually exist, at least as we fantasize him as having supernatural powers.  But the teachings and moral code of Jesus/Christianity is an entirely separate entity that exists outside of any supernatural belief.  And it is this observation that makes me ask why/how the United States can call itself a Christian nation and do the things it does?  Or you substitute ""Christain nation"" for ""morally superior"" or some other similar term.  I think it's a fairly prominent belief here that ""we are the good guys,"" so whatever we have to do to maintain our power and lifestyle, we are absolutely justified in doing.  But how can you be a true Christian, and actively support that?  That seems to directly contradict the teachings of Jesus in so many ways.  Please prove me wrong.  And please provide specific examples.

968,"CMV: Volunteer Fire departments should not exist, all fire fighting officials should be paid and trained employees of the state",TRUE,1,t3_3atkce,"So I've always kind of thought that it was ridiculous that my hometowns line of defense against fires was a bunch of volunteers. I know that they do receive training but knowing some of them personally they really take it all as some joke- not saying that all volunteers do -but I think that if your going to be in charge of saving someones life and are going to risk your own life you should be a paid professional.

Other than the argument that paying firefighters is too expensive for the state why the heck else do all these small towns rely on locals to just figure it out themselves.

**Edit:** 

**Please see thndrchld and Mine's conversation below**

&gt;And as far a what I said by taking it as a joke I know a kid that joined because he wanted to shack-up in a fire engine, An ex of mine's grandfather was the long running lead volunteer fighter and often joke that if a N****'s house caught fire he'd let them burn- these are the things that went on in my small home town.
&gt;And that is one of the main reason that i feel this should be handled by professionals, not just and guy off the street with his own agenda.- so one more question- if you were volunteering with either of the guys I mentioned what would you do? and how could you have those people removed?

**celeritas365 made a good point**

&gt;What about mixed? In my town we have some professionals and some volunteers. Some of the volunteers are more for support and can't go into a burning building. The stuff that happens outside is still important. Why pay a full firefighter when you don't need all of his or her skills? Also, much of what fire departments do is checking for fires when a house alarm goes off and doing small yet important things like chemically treating gasoline spills from auto accidents so they don't catch fire. While important, I don't see why a team of ALL professional firefighters need to do these tasks.

I think maybe thats what i mean more- There should be professionals at all depts, no ALL volunteer depts should exist.- that also solves the money issue with for example 1 pro for every 5 volunteers.

**Ada1629 Also had a good point on my thoughts**
&gt;However, I feel uncomfortable with people working for free - it becomes suspect to me that something more nefarious is going on 
&gt;I also question how stringent the rules are when there is nothing on the line but free labor for those doing the ""hiring""?

1432,"CMV: Being Transgender to the point of wanting surgery or hormonal treatment is a mental illness, and saying otherwise is harmful to both transgender people and to the stigma surrounding mental illness.",TRUE,1,t3_367d1j,"Being transgender and wanting surgery/hormonal treatment is being so uncomfortable with yourself as a person that you need invasive surgery, or completely body-altering hormonal treatment to feel comfortable. I think that the only reason we don't define it as that is political correctness, combined with the stigma around mental illness. Transgender people don't want to be lumped in with other people with mental illnesses because there is a such a stigma against it. And if society starts treating transgender people as having no mental issue, and accepting invasive surgery as the standard treatment then that will slow research towards less drastic treatments.

Ideally, in the future, if someone were to come into a doctor's office and say ""I feel so bad in my current body that I want hormonal treatment and invasive surgery"" the doctor would be able to prescribe something that would just make the transgender person no longer feel terrible in their current body.

177,CMV: ‘Be yourself’ is a totally useless piece of advice.,TRUE,1,t3_3hgan4,"What does it even mean? How can one not be one-self? 

Now I’m mostly talking about the everyday use of the phrase – where it is typically offered moments before an uncomfortable or unfamiliar social interaction, like a date.

And in this scenario, I assume it means something like ‘be yourself but without any of the debilitating neurosis and subsequent façade’.
But this is just as useless. Don’t you think if people could magically wish away such impediments, they would have already done so? It’s possible that some people are able to do this – but then they presumably wouldn’t be in need of such banal advice. 

But even if you are held back by anxiety / hiding behind a façade etc. – are these things not an integral part of the ego that constitutes the ‘self’? Wouldn’t someone co-existing with these neuroses be closer to their ‘true self’ (whatever that is) than someone trying to change their mental state? Perhaps. Though how can anyone be ‘other’ than ‘themself’? It seems like whatever a person does, by definition, is being themself. 

Maybe ‘be yourself’ means ‘don’t pretend to be someone you’re not’? Again, this very act of pretending is still ‘me’ being ‘myself’.  If I pretend, then I am a pretender, and that’s who I am. 

Does it mean ‘be your best self? If we could just flip a switch and become our ‘best self’ – wouldn’t everyone leave it on all the time?   

‘Don’t overthink’? Fuck you. Don’t underthink. 

Is it just empty rhetoric meant as bit of comfort / a morale boost?  Well then don’t dress it up in misleading instructions. ‘There, there’ would be more useful / plain. 
 
Also, even if my ‘true self’ is for some reason a ‘me’ without these hang-ups - much of this assumes I have any choice or ability or inclination to change it, and that free will exists (which I’m inclined to doubt – but that’s another issue). 

Finally, it’s usually a cop-out on the part of the advisor, who incites this cliché in lieu of anything more profound or nuanced or comprehensive or useful.

1201,"CMV: If you're ok with how athletes are paid, you should be ok with how CEOs are paid",FALSE,0,t3_38kidg,"There's a lot of debate about how some people are ""paid too much"" for what they do. I frequently find that people who think CEOs are paid too much have no issues with how much athletes and movie stars are paid.

CEOs, athletes, and movie star pay are all subject to the same laws of supply and demand. The owners of the movie, owners of the team, and owners of the company, agree to pay the amount.

What's similar among them all are that they often don't last very long. These are high profile people. Mistakes, poor performance, and even bad luck means your contract won't be getting renewed and any chance of future employment can be lost.

These types of talents are what owners try to bring on board in hopes that they will make lots of money for them. To say that an athlete should not be paid so much is the same as saying the owner of the team should not be allowed to spend his money a certain way. I don't see how it is different for shareholders looking to employ a CEO.

At the end of the day, all of these are dictated by supply and demand. No one pays millions for an athlete if he doesn't believe that athlete would be an asset to the team. If someone is willing to pay the amount, there is at the very least, the belief that the amount is worth it. You pay a popular actor a lot because you're receiving the ticket sales of his fan base. You pay a CEO a lot because he knows how to negotiate better deals with suppliers or can provide the vision for the next product.

TLDR - There's no difference between CEO's, athletes, and actors being paid a lot. If you're ok with one, you should be ok with them all.",1201,TRUE,,TRUE,1
978,CMV: The Confederate Flag should be federally banned from any state or municipal building as well as any company drawing federal benefits,FALSE,0,t3_3aqhn2,"Note: This is going to be kinda long because I'm kinda angry and I think this is a good idea, but I'd like to understand the counter arguments. 

Background: In the wake of the Charleston shooting many people on Reddit, and in the real world, have pointed out that we're poised to go through the same four step routine we've all become way too used to after events like this.

1. Fight about gun control

2. Discuss the amorphous ""mental health"" problem without any specifics

3. Bicker about something other than the actual problem. For instance, religious persecution instead of racial prejudice.

4. Get bored and forget about it.

Many people have been outraged over the fact that despite such comically obvious evidence that this was a racially motivated act, we're not going to do anything about the growing race problem in the U.S...again. Even going so far as not lowering the Confederate Flag outside the South Carolina Capitol building because that flag inexplicably requires a 2/3rds vote to lower. That has in turn raised, or re-raised the issue of stubborn insistence on using antebellum symbols and homages all throughout the South, which many people have pointed out as indicative of the pervasive racial biases throughout the country. 

The Idea: A federal law banning flying the Flag of the Confederation outside any public or municipal building, as well as a phasing out of all names associated with the Confederation from public roadways, buildings, etc. 

The Rationale: There are so many reasons, but I'll try to keep it succinct and duck most of the moral policing. First, It is tremendously offensive to black citizens, which, is fairly self-explanatory, and frankly should be to white citizens as well. Setting aside the racial implications, which we shouldn't, the Confederate Flag is a symbol of treason. Not only that, we are the only developed nation that not only displays, but does so with pride, symbols of our darker past. South African government buildings do not fly the Rhodesian flag, nor do the Japanese fly the Imperial flag. Germans have damn near made the Nazi flag a punishable offense.  How can the U.S. maintain any sort of moral high ground when we're rubbing slavery in the faces of ~15% of Americans? 

On the more implicit side, this is a very late, but very necessary, line in the sand against the more insidiously underground racial biases we still have. We're not going to tolerate this any more. The atmosphere that allowed Dylann Roof to foster and nurture his beliefs. No, not all beliefs are acceptable anymore, and you're going to have to stand out in the open if you hold these destructive beliefs. The government cannot continue a tacit tolerance of such a simple and easily solved FIRST step to mending race relations. It starts here, at the Flag, and we're actually going to stat working on our race issues.

So that's my stance. CMV

88,"CMV: r/changemyview is essentially ""Teach me How to Groupthink"".",TRUE,1,t3_3iammm,"First off, this is an exciting new subreddit for me and I love the idea.
However, I can't seem to shake feeling that many of the posts here stem from people's discomfort with their own nonconformity and outlying ideas more than from a thirst for truth.

Additional info: I am currently writing an essay on the phenomenon of 'groupthink' so the theme is ripe in my mind.
I showed this sub to a friend of mine who immediately believes the moral statuses quo of Tumblr, including contradicting ideas, and has always seemed to me to have difficulty breaking social norms and thinking for herself. Her immediate reaction was to dismiss all posts she saw as 'stupid' (that'd be the first page of 'hot' at time of posting). This, no doubt, has influenced my view.

I'd like to highlight again that I am excited to have found this sub and I'll be visiting here often. But I'd like to discuss this idea first.

P.S. I'm so meta I post requests for people to change my view about /r/changemyview on /r/changemyview as a critique of /r/changemyview.

669,CMV: I should refrain from sexual activity due to the potential of false rape accusations.,TRUE,1,t3_3dgf6j,"For context, I'm an 18 year-old male who will be entering college this comming fall. 

This issue has only been a concern of mine in recent months, in part due my exposure to the idea on reddit/other internet sources, and partly because I've never been in an environment where sexual encounters are frequent. I don't think I'm of the party that has difficulty understanding consent. I also understand that there may be a great deal of fear for some women that they may be raped, and I don't wish to sound as though I'm downplaying that. But I have a fear myself of being falsely accused, or accused in a case where consent is retroactively removed. I don't think of this potential as being very high; I don't think most women are that vindictive; however in the event that it occurs it seems the results can be devastating. I've personally spoken to someone who has gone through this process and it took him almost a year to clear his name. 

I don't want this fear; I'm very open to the idea that it may be exaggerated in the media I've read, or that there are faults in my reasoning. But these are potentials and I can't seem to confirm them on my own; maybe someone else can poke some holes.

613,CMV: The Ashley Madison hack was unjustified and is doing more harm than good.,FALSE,0,t3_3e0cyz,"As someone who has admittedly cheated before and learned from my terrible decisions, I feel like this is completely wrong. However, literally EVERYONE I have talked to or asked their opinion about it today has told me that I'm wrong or that these people deserve it, yadda yadda. So here's my thoughts:

I don't feel like this hack is justified. I DO feel like cheaters are terrible people and having been on both sides I feel I've got a pretty good un-biased opinion of it. It hurts and hurting someone else is even worse, or at least to me it ended up feeling that way. But I don't think it's right that all of these people are getting exposed like this. This sounds terrible to a lot of people but, ignorance really can be bliss. Someone can be cheated on and be better off never knowing. The cheater may even have a change of heart and or regret their decision for the rest of their married life and do everything in their power to make up for it without ever actually coming out about it, making for a very happy relationship. Thing is, some of those kinds of people may very well have been using this site. Or people in open relationships where it woulda been okay regardless.

Yet everyone I talk to says ""they're getting what they deserve"" and yea, i mean, i get it, sometimes some people do deserve to be punished for something they did but, this feels wrong. I don't think they should be humiliated if they could have avoided it. There's a lot of reasons someone could have used this site, like distant spouses, emotional affairs, family shaming... and they dont deserve to be publicly humiliated. And its definitely not right for some hacker to just be able to do this all from the safety of being anonymous.

Everybody makes mistakes, doesn't mean you should be punished/humiliated for it. You can change or learn otherwise without that.

406,CMV: Non-radical libertarianism is the political philosophy most compatible with utilitarianism.,TRUE,1,t3_3fjf42,"So I tend to hold a utilitarian viewpoint, and specifically one concerned with human wellbeing (putting little intrinsic value, but substantial instrumental value on animal wellbeing).

From this premise, I further believe that a society in which free markets are the dominant economic force, and governments do the minimum reasonably possible to interfere with them is the optimal structure for producing the most long-term good for humans overall.

As a first point, I believe that market economies have been remarkably successful in producing material wealth.  I as a middle-income westerner live in far greater luxury than did Louis XIV, and I believe markets are the primary structural reason why.

Further, I believe that material wealth is a key source of human happiness and satisfaction in life - maximization of which is the core objective of a human-focused utilitarianism.  As some evidence for this, I would point to [this excellent paper by economists Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers](http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2013/04/subjective-well-being-income).  It finds, from a truly enormous number of studies, a robust linear-log relationship between income and reported happiness or life satisfaction.

Third, I believe that pro-market policies are likely to continue to promote economic growth.  As evidence, I would point to the massive reduction of poverty in China since the adoption of a a private market system, which is probably the single greatest humanitarian miracle of the past 100 years.

Now, I should define my terms a bit here.

When I say non-radical libertarianism I mean a model of the state roughly in line with modern liberal-democratic states.  In general, that would include the existence of some level of a welfare state, nor of progressive taxation schemes.  It would however strongly favor policies in that vein which minimize market interference - so things like cash transfers as opposed to in-kind transfers or government provision of goods and services.  It would also include a robust protection for the right to private property, and for civil and political rights.

As an example of where this would diverge substantially from current policies of liberal democracies, the right of people to migrate between countries is a key civil right which produces I think extraordinary human wellbeing which is routinely denied to people.

**TL;DR:**  Libertarian pro-market policies make more stuff than other policies.  Stuff makes people happy.  Happiness is the goal of utilitarianism.  Ergo, libertarian pro-market policies effectuate utilitarianism more than other policies.

647,CMV: You cannot be a social progressive and against freedom of speech.,TRUE,1,t3_3dnhsi," Most social progressives, love democracy, and so it is of relatively little surprise to me that as they have achieved a majority (in Reddit and the West), that they want to exercise their new-found power over reactionary groups.  I would offer, however, that at one point in time they were a minority, and with the advent of freedom of speech, their voices were allowed to shine in free, open, democratic discourse.  I find it very disturbing that people who claim to be supporting ""social progress"" in society want to begin delimiting and banning thinkers who already exist as a minority that rests outside the norm of consensual decency.  

You cannot use a principle of liberal social democracy, and then turn around and illiberally and antisocially try to close the door behind you.   This understanding that freedom of speech is ""good while it benefits us, but bad when it doesn't"" is exactly the reason why it must exist, and was the very mechanism that gave us social progress: to allow individuals or minority groups to challenge the group-think of the masses.

Most of the top replies (the ones that are expected to change the view of the OP) usually disregard and ignore the original view.

Right now there is a thread about bikers being assholes. The top reply is someone saying, ""not all bikers, there are some exceptions""

while that's true, I'd imagine that the vast majority of people still feel that bikers in general are assholes. [Even south park made an episode about them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGyKBFCd_u4). 


The top replies don't address the view of bikers being assholes in general. the response is ""not all"" but it doesn't change the view, and the exception is not the rule.

I keep finding this issue, people find one little exception and then suddenly that's the most popular post. I rarely find a top post that addresses the whole of the OP, but rather takes one part out, nit picks it and that's what rises to the top.

503,CMV: The US government should give everyone a personal retirement fund.,FALSE,0,t3_3esskw,"I think the US government should give every citizen a lump sum at birth or naturalization, and invest it for them in an index fund modeled on (and possibly administered alongside) the Thrift Savings Plan funds for Federal employees.  The funds would be kept in the account until the person reaches age 65 and then be able to be withdrawn tax free like a Roth IRA.

Because of the very long timeframe, even a small lump sum like $1000 could become quite a lot of money.  Stocks have about a 7% inflation adjusted rate of return over the very long run.  Even assuming a somewhat lower rate like 5%, you'd be multiplying the money by 24x after inflation.  At 7%, you'd be multiplying by 81x.  

There are about 4 million births and 800,000 naturalizations in the US each year.  For rounding sake, call it 5 million people.  So the total program cost at $1000 per capita would be about $5 billion a year, which is a very small slice of the Federal budget, plus admin costs, which wouldn't be that huge.

If you extended it to current citizens, which I think would be advisable as well, you'd add a one time lump sum payment of $300 billion or so, which is substantial, but is smaller than a lot of economic stimulus programs.

For persons already born or naturalized, I'd do this also as a one time payment.  I'd probably copy the Roth rules and make it subject to a penalty for withdrawal in the first 5 years, but with no withdrawal permitted before 65.

I would default people into one of the TSP's lifecycle funds based on year of birth (probably needing to make some new ones since TSP doesn't make plans targeted at infants), but let them change their allocation within the TSP if they chose.

Doing this would substantially aid people in retiring with dignity, provide a lot of people with a toehold in the market which would encourage future investments, and leverage a small initial investment over a really long time frame to get big future benefits.

Additionally, making the accounts locked from withdrawals (which you can only really do with government seed money) will provide people with some guarantee of savings at retirement, and protect against financial calamity completely wiping them out.

255,CMV: College Tuition should not be completely government subsidized,FALSE,0,t3_3gq2wl,"So, I'm writing this as an American, and one of the big crux points of Bernie Sander's policy is fully subsidizing college with government funds. I really think that's a bad for a few reasons.

1. There are a ton of jobs that already require college degrees that frankly probably shouldn't. You don't even need a degree in the same field as what you're doing sometimes, they just want 'a degree.' This would instead put the burden of a nearly useless degree on the community, instead of the individual. Why should I be helping pay for someone who majored in one thing only to go work somewhere completely different?

2. There are already government subsidized educations, such as federal service academies, ROTC programs, some doctors/lawyers that get picked up by the military, among other programs. They get their education paid for in return for service to the government. This makes sense to me, the government is getting people who are educated in a specific way that they need in return for paying for their education. You couldn't feasibly employ this type of program over the whole country because some people want to take degrees in something the government has no use for. 

3. This is essentially making college degrees completely necessary. It would be nearly free, or so cheap that almost everyone can afford it, even though some people are not going to be able to hack it. College is not for everyone, it's meant to push your boundaries and really develop critical thinking skills. What do you do for the people who are not capable of receiving a college degree? What if they go, and flunk out? Does the government still foot that bill? That would be a waste of money. Would they be forced to pay it back? That's penalizing someone who already is going to have a tough time making money. 

I am in favor of fixing how the system works. People who get a degree, and are successful (which isn't everyone) still have years and years of huge debts to pay off. We need to figure out a way to cap those debts off, make it more affordable. Not every college degree makes a ton of money, particularly some professions where a college degree is very necessary, so we need to work on that. I just really don't think a full subsidy is the wrong move.

Tell me why using xe or something like it in our every day language wouldn't be good.

I can see some people holding the view that this word has been dirtied by some people *cough tumblr *cough but i still believe that it wouldn't matter if a lot of people used it.

1493,CMV: I don't think I should spend every waking hour of my teenage life trying to get into a good college,TRUE,1,t3_35oag9,"I'm a really bad student, like a really bad student. In certain classes I simply do not do the homework and in all classes I rarely ever study. I understand perfectly where this will get me, but I am simply not willing to throw all my time and energy into things I see as unnecessary. 

Don't get me wrong I'm not some party high schooler, quite the opposite really. I am an all honors student with many AP classes that I have been scheduled to take next year after taking one AP class this year (sophomore year). I don't waste my time with things I see as trivial and slowly school has turned into something I see as trivial. Instead of doing my school work I spend timing learning how to program or watching a documentary on issues in this world. I write, I read, and I just try to learn everything I can but just not at school. I feel like I need the freedom to choose what I do and when I do it and I am just not allowed this with school.

Every morning I wake up at 6:45 sit through painstakingly boring classes with rare highlights as there is just one or two classes I can somewhat enjoy. If there's a test it's a 50/50 that I'll turn it in half blank and if it's a lecture or some other activity I'll tune in only once awhile to get the gist of the lesson. I sometimes look around to my peers and see people with 4.0+ gpa's who are completely focused on school. I see them during free periods doing all the work assigned and I see them get mad when they get 2 points taken off. When I see this I can appreciate the effort, but at the end of the day there are literally thousands of other people just like them. Every school in the country has a couple valedictorians who will all be competing to get into the ""best"" colleges and a majority of them will not make it.

I think I understand the importance of college and I feel like I would excel at some of the top university, but as of now I not chasing that 4.0+ gpa required to get there and I don't see myself doing that anytime soon. I love to learn, I really love to learn and I teach myself new things I find interesting and useful everyday. That passion continues grow but it's pushing me away from going to the best colleges which I have been told will allow me to achieve the things I want to do. So please tell me why I should need to get that 4.0+ gpa and go to the best of the best of colleges. I want to help the world, but I'm not sure I'm going about it in the right way.

Edit: Thanks for all the advice guys. It's been very helpful and I'll be visiting this thread in the future when my determination will inevitably falter.

579,CMV: There's a contradiction between people being born transgender and the genders being the same,FALSE,0,t3_3e9kal,"* Gender does not determine behavior, preference, or inclinations.
* Transgender people are born that way.

I consider myself fairly liberal. I'm in the middle, politically. These two views are actually ones I tend to agree with, but I find them to be in contradiction.

To elaborate:

* Gender does not determine behavior, preference, or inclinations.

I believe that a woman, for instance, was not born to want to nurture. Girls play with barbies because that's what is given to them. And females' roles in society is not ingrained in them. Males aren't all made to hunt, compete, and fight, either.

And I hands down believe that transgender people are born the way they are. Their urges to be the opposite of their birth sex is not something that chose or could choose to ignore. Yet, that can manifest itself in things like wanting to dress up in dresses or grow a beard. And once they transition, many transgender people I see take on traditional, stereotypical roles of their new genders.

So can these two ideas co-exist? I feel they can't, yet I still believe them both equally.

418,CMV: Rock music is no longer culturally relevant,TRUE,1,t3_3feqzt,"Rock and Roll music is no longer an important part of the cultural conversation. This is obviously not to say that there is no longer rock music being made, that that music is never popular, or that that contemporary rock music isn't good. But rock has become similar to jazz and classical—while there is still lots of it being made, it's not a powerful cultural force any more. The modern cultural conversation is being played out in hip-hop and EDM.

Of the current Top 10 on the Billboard charts, the only rock single is ""Shut Up and Dance"" by Walk the Moon, at #9, and that song is heavily influenced by EDM. The current Song of the Summer is generally agreed to be Fetty Wap's ""Trap Queen."" The most consistently popular rock band currently is probably either the Foo Fighters, a band that has been around since the late 90s and still plays a very similar style of music to what they were playing then (and arguably still owe a large portion of their popularity to nostalgia for Nirvana, a band whose largest cultural moment was 24 years ago), or the Black Keys, a band playing with a deliberately retro style. 

Tame Impala and Arcade Fire, two bands that have been lauded for their innovation in the rock genre have on their most recent albums embraced EDM influences, and largely moved away from guitar-based rock. 

I would argue that the most culturally important albums of the past few months have been outside of rock—Kendrick Lamar's *To Pimp A Butterfly*, Drake's *If You're Reading This It's Too Late*, Mark Ronson's *Uptown Special*, Taylor Swift's *1989* (in which she ditched her country roots for an embrace of EDM pop).

There has been a lot of rock music recently that has been great too (Father John Misty, Courtney Barnett, Colleen Green, and Jim O'Rourke have all released albums I have absolutely loved, and I just listened to the new Titus Andronicus album yesterday) but that has become an exception, and as my examples point out, it's not really commercially popular or culturally relevant beyond a small core. 

I don't have a real problem with rock losing its cultural cachet. I love rap, R&amp;B, and electronica as well, and think that there is a lot of great innovation going on in modern music (and even that 2015 is an all-time stand-out year). But I think that rock has lost its importance in the wider culture, and that rock music is now even imbued with an inherent feeling of throwback, the way that jazz now makes people think of a certain time period even as jazz continues to innovate to this day.

1123,CMV:The vast majority of women are NOT attracted to money.,FALSE,0,t3_39g8hn,"I am constantly seeing guys with the opinion that women are attracted more to a guys wallet than his appearance or who he is as a person. Of course there will be some exceptions where a woman is actually attracted to the financial opportunities with a guy, but I feel most women are more attracted to the other traits that most successful and wealthy people have.

The traits I'm referring to are passion, drive, ambition and confidence. A guy could have all of these things and direct them towards something like charity and the majority of women are still going to be very attracted to him. Most times though, these personality traits lead toward success which then leads to wealth.

It's easy to recognize expensive things like nice cars and clothing that we don't have and associate that as to the difference between ourselves and the stranger with the beautiful girlfriend. It's not easy to see a strangers personality as they are walking to their car in the parking lot of the shopping mall. It's human instinct to notice patterns and try to learn from them. It makes sense we would think that wealth and beautiful girls go hand in hand. But in reality, the girlfriend he has was not originally attracted to his wallet, but his hard work ethic and the confidence he had in himself and what he was doing.

Edit: I'd like to add competence as a major factor in what attracts a women to a man.

1354,"CMV: It's not ""creeping"", ""snooping"", or ""being a creeper"" to browse social media content that presumably was put there for exactly that purpose.",TRUE,1,t3_36utu6,"**Edit:** I didn't expect this to get such a response. I've replied to some things and gave out some deltas, but as I won't have time to address everything, I'll summarize in an edit. I think that I already more or less agreed with the principle behind the issue, but I actually misunderstood what the issue was. People aren't so stupid as to think that the things they post online are *private,* but there's a social expectation that you will get information from the source rather than digging up (or participating in) old conversations/content that had nothing to do with you, similar to overhearing a conversation at a restaurant and bringing it up when you meet one of those people later. And then there are better and worse ways to bring up the information you found, if it's a good idea to bring it up at all. In a way some of you have CMV by helping me understand what the problem actually is, so I have posted some deltas. 

Thanks

I don't know if this is much of a phenomenon, but I see it often enough that I have to wonder whether this is the way society's thinking is turning now. 

Suppose Susie makes a facebook page, and posts on it pictures of herself and her friends and their activities, some personal trivia, etc. Now her acquaintance Frankie from school mentions in conversation one of the pictures, something she'd said at some point, etc. Susie reacts negatively to this, and calls Frankie a ""creep"" for ""looking through"" her profile. 

I'm 24, but as I've been online since sometime during Windows 95, it's been long enough that I'm allowed to have ""good old days"".  And in the good old days, there was no such thing as ""creeping someone's profile"" online. Putting aside when a ""profile"" became a thing. We had web pages, with content we had written, that we wanted as many people as possible to see. We didn't spend all those hours perfecting Javascript mouse trailers and visitor counters and guestbooks for nothing, you know. On these web pages we might have listed all sorts of borderline personally identifying information, or in some cases, all of it. You can still find some super throwback web 1.0 vanity sites where people have straight-up posted their resumes, and more. 

So the same thing happens now, except on Facebook or so, and the difference I can see is that, back when I was a teenager (xanga 4 lyf yo) and we were all doing it, we somehow managed to remember what we had posted on the public internet, and we didn't lose our shit when someone happened to know something that we had told them ... albeit indirectly ... by putting it online ...

I feel like I'm close to the core reason behind this new perspective, but I'm not sure. It's like these people either don't understand how the internet and social media work and are meant to be used in a literal way, or maybe their own metaphors are getting in the way of seeing the reality. Maybe they want their Facebook to be like their high-school bedroom that they've decorated with posters of Ricky Martin, and they have a little diary where they bitch about their poor tragic suburban lives, and nobody else is allowed in there and if you go in and look at their photos or remember too specifically their words, you're a terrible creep, except instead of a bedroom they have erected a large bulletin board in the town square, started posting text and images to it, and got mad when people came to look at them.

1353,"CMV: Being biologically related is no more than that, there's no emotional bond.",FALSE,0,t3_36wdmm,"It's more complicated than I could put in a title. I mean in specific situations. I saw a post describing a couple that had a baby together and their journey. The woman had met her now-husband after having slept with a different man. She found out she was pregnant from that encounter, the couple married and the husband treats the baby as if it were his biologically. There were so many butthurt comments asking if the couple had ever told the biological father about the baby, asking if he had a say in the matter, etc. The mother actually had told the bio dad that she had gotten pregnant, apparently he wasn't a great person. What I don't understand is why being biologically related entitles a person to a child's life. If the argument is ""You did it, your responsibility"", there shouldn't be a problem because there's already a father willing to take the responsibility. I'm not talking about sperm donors, because it goes with being a donor that your involvement includes sperm and nothing else. I mean, if the man had wanted children, there are a lot of ways he could have them- naturally, adopting, surrogates, etc. He didn't have sex with the woman with the intention of having a baby, so why should he be considered as anything but a genetic relative? If I sneezed on a stranger and found out a year later they had somehow had a baby from my sneeze cells, what right would I have to get angry and demand involvement and power over decisions in its life? The thing that's most confusing is that the people getting angry over biological rights are mostly people without religious or supernatural beliefs, so why are they under the impression that sharing DNA creates an emotional bond? I understand there are holes in my stance, and I have nothing against biological parents or any kind of surrogacy, step parent, foster situation. I just genuinely don't understand what reason people have for believing this way.

Afterthought- Perhaps a clearer title would be ""Being biologically related shouldn't grant any parental or family rights/involvement. As far as I know, I can't edit the title.

228,CMV: College isn't for me.,FALSE,0,t3_3gz08h,"Help please change my view. 

First off, here are my reasons:

1) It's too expensive. Many college graduates have a huge amount of student debt, and many students dropout because of financial problems. 

2) I'm not smart. I'm a senior in high school. Actually a senior with junior credits. I'm missing 1.5 credits. 1.0 for math and 0.5 for Biology. I see college is for people who are lucky, smart, or rich. Most smart kids from my school were given scholarships because well... they were smart. The lucky few are people who are in sports and sometimes people like that little kid who went to McDonald's for some light to do his homework. And for the rich kids, obviously they have the money to get in there. From what I heard from other people, college won't take you if you're SATS aren't great or your GPA isn't up to par. I was really discouraged about that. Me unable to attend college because I'm not good at one subject. 

3) A huge waste of time. Many jobs requires a minimum of a high school diploma. As I start researching the jobs that I wanted, I started to slowly realize that most of the job I need requires a college degree. I really wanted to take Filmmaking, but I heard rumors about why taking it isn't worth it. But that's a whole different story. And another one is, I wanted to be a cop. I heard from other people that in order to be a cop, you need a college degree. And as stated in reason 2, I don't think I'm able to go to college to be a cop or a filmmaker because I'm broke and ""not smart"". 

I'm joining the Air Force, and I know the military can help you with education student loans and all that, but once I start thinking about it, it goes straight to reason 2. I'm plain out stupid. No matter how much time I spend studying math or being tutored, I can never get it. Math isn't for me. 

Money and math is the only thing that is stopping me going to college.",228,TRUE,,FALSE,0
571,CMV: A shrinking population size is a good thing,TRUE,1,t3_3ec84d,"If population replacement rates are below the rate of no growth or at stagnation, things are going to be better in the future. As automation continues to improve, less jobs will be available. On a nationwide scale, decreasing population means available work. Natural resources of food, water, fuel, and other materials are becoming scarcer everyday. On a global scale, less population means more available goods to all. What result(s) of an increasing population size could surpass these benefits? If we were hypothetically at the growth cap for the human population, would everybody still get frantic like when it's is brought up that the U.S. born citizen population is reproducing below replacement?

Edit: it seems a lot of the response pertain to economy. I suppose I was wrong in respect to a declining population being beneficial in this aspect. However, I still seem to feel that a shrinking population would benefit us as a species. Our survival, and that of our environment, would be better off with less people.

158,CMV: Only registered members of a political party should be permitted to seek and obtain that party's nomination for elected office.,FALSE,0,t3_3hl45h,"The 2016 US presidential primary race is well underway, and the large pool of candidates in both major political parties is exposing a significant gap in the nominating process. Some of the leading candidates are of questionable party affiliation (e.g. Donald  Trump is now a registered Republican but has faced criticism for switching parties throughout his lifetime; Lincoln Chafee was a Republican while serving as a Mayor, Senator, and Governor, and only became a Democrat in 2013) or are unabashedly independent of any party affiliation (Bernie Sanders is not a registered Democrat but still running for the Democratic nomination).  

This has led to a lot of controversy on both sides about throwing the weight of the party behind someone whose allegiance to the party is questionable, and with good reason. For the following reasons, I believe that by law only registered members of a political party should be able to seek and obtain that party's nomination for elected office. 

1) Parties spend a substantial amount of resources to try to elect their nominees. These resources often come from contributions (in terms of money, activism, work hours etc) governed by election law made by party members or supporters to support fellow party members. It is inappropriate to allocate these resources to someone who, despite achieving the nomination, is not even a member of the party in the first place.

2) Many third parties with access to general election ballots often nominate the same person, which causes that individual to appear on the ballot several times for the same position. This duplication is unfair to candidates from other parties (especially third parties) who may only appear on the ballot once. For the purposes of the official ballot, parties should only be allowed to formally nominate their own members, or no one at all. 

3) The members of a political party's presidential ticket are the de facto leaders of their national party during and (if elected) after the election. The same principle applies for nominees for Governor at the state-level, Mayor at the municipality-level, etc. Nominees' political positions are often absorbed into the general party platform, which can impact elections and party voter turnout elsewhere. It is nonsensical, and unfair to party members, for their de facto leaders to be from another party or no party at all, especially given that nominations are mostly a function of popular vote. (Tangentially, I am also opposed to ""open primaries"" where voters who aren't registered members of a political party can still vote in that party's primary election, but I suppose that's a topic for another CMV post. And of course, it should continue to be against election rules to be a registered member of more than one political party.)

4) There is nothing wrong with or prohibitive about running for office as an independent. Ross Perot staged a pretty successful third party run for president in 1992. Sanders is the longest serving independent in the Senate. Many other people have been elected to political office at various levels of government without obtaining a major party nomination. Our political system does not preclude independents from winning elections, so any argument that an independent's only real chance of winning is to seek the nomination of a party with which (s)he does not formally affiliate is historically and demonstrably invalid. 

CMV.

**Edit:** I understand a lot of people on reddit are Bernie Sanders supporters, and that my view might argue against his candidacy in the Democratic primary. For the record, I am not a Clinton or a Trump supporter; nor am I decidedly against Sanders as a candidate if he makes to the general election. I hope my replies are not being downvoted (against this sub's rules) because I am not 100% in favor of Sanders.

1131,CMV: The Minimum Wage is Immoral.,FALSE,0,t3_39csdz,"I've heard some decent arguments for why the minimum wage is ineffective, but that is not what I'm arguing here. I believe the concept of the minimum wage itself is inherently immoral.

I think that society *should* provide a baseline which no citizen will be allowed to fall below, but this burden should be shared equally. The minimum wage arbitrarily puts this cost on to companies that use low-skilled workers. Google doesn't provide their employees with a modern cafeteria and relatively high pay simply because they are a great humanitarian organization. They do it because the work they do requires highly-skilled workers and the market demands this kind of work be compensated with higher prices, and as a result, they don't have the media and politicians attacking them for being cruel to their employees despite simply paying them the market rate for their work.

If we had something like a universal basic income similar to the [Negative Income Tax](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtpgkX588nM), then this would ensure that all tax-paying citizens helped contribute to maintaining a safety net in the country. Instead, the minimum wage is a discriminatory tax that targets certain companies and ignores others based not on any moral principle, but instead on an arbitrary aspect of the work they do.

I am generally a happy and healthy person. I was raised Catholic. I am not a strict Catholic. I enjoy the community of church. I don't take everything at face value or for fact. About 8 years ago I came to terms that there is probably no Heaven. Death is just ceasing to exist. I was okay with that. I still felt we had souls or spirits. I still hoped for or had affection for the possibility of a God, even though it probably didn't exist. I still hoped for an afterlife of some sort, even though I didn't know what it would manifest as and that the chance of one was actually quite slim. I felt my children were a blessing. Their births were the most beautiful, tender days of my life. I took joy and pride in everything my kids did. Some days I would just well up with pride and happiness, so happy that our lives have been rich and lucky. Any thoughts of death or mortality were far, far from my mind. I just didn't think about those types of things. Sure, the thoughts flitted through my mind every now and then and I would think about them. I would discuss it with my spouse. Usually I would take comfort in the intense love and happiness we have and know that no matter what happens at the end, somehow we would still go on, whether it be in the hearts or memories of others, in some type of spirit/soul that survived death, in photos or videos . . . The jury was out on what happens, but I was at least accepting or positive about it. 




Now, I feel like a shattered, empty person.




As I've gotten older, I have developed high blood pressure (family history). My doctor put me on Atenolol 50mg once a day. About four days in, I started to feel sad and question my mortality and my family's mortality out of nowhere. Things just spiraled out of control after that. I learned about nihilism, atheism, existentialism, what happens after death, that we are just computers, emotions aren't real, just by-products of brain impulses ... just lots of things I never thought about before and I became incredibly depressed. Crying everyday, scared of the eventuality of our lives, the meaningless of life, the possible lack of a soul, no proof of an afterlife ... I feel like I've been down a horribly dark rabbit hole and I want to get out.




I went back to my doctor and he said Atenolol, being a beta blocker, can cause depression, so he took me off of it. I was on it for two weeks. My last dose was about 96 hours ago. I'm not feeling much better. How long does it take the medication to get out of my system and for all my brain chemistry to start working again? I'm having a lot of trouble finding meaning in what I do, and what I do with my family since there's no point. We won't remember anything after we die. Why do I care if I get some award at work? What do I care if my kid gets in the school play? Why celebrate someone's birthday? I feel empty. I feel hollow. I do not want to feel like this.
Could this really all be a cause of the medicine? Or did I do this to myself? Will my feelings of happiness and excitement come back? Will I find meaning again? How long until I could be ""back to normal?"" 




This current depressive state is so unlike me and nothing I have ever experienced before. I'm scared I'll always have these depressing thoughts about mortality and life's meaning that I just don't want in my head anymore. I want to rewind the last two weeks and go back to my jovial, excited, proud self that I was. I want to believe in what I used to believe in. I feel like now that I've researched what really happens after death, or researched that we probably have no souls, that we are just a product of brain chemistry, that I can never go back to how I was. I WANT to, though. I feel like now that I've gotten a peek at what we really are (sophisticated computers) that I can never be happy again. I don't want to know these truths. I want to go back to how I was. I am losing meaning in anything I do.  I am becoming detatched from my children and spouse. I don't enjoy doing anything with them. It's all just a reminder that they will die someday, too. I don't want to live in a world where they don't exist, but that's where I am destined to be and it destroys me. I can't look at my kids and be happy anymore, knowing that anything we do is meaningless. Yes, I know there are the arguments that YOU have to provide meaning and make something out of the life you are given, but that doesn't help me feel better at all. It makes me feel worse. I feel like I have to work now to assign or find meaning, rather than it just naturally occurring and flowing and being part of my day-to-day life. My kid drew a picture today and happily showed me. All I could muster was a ""nice job,"" instead of my usual effortless pride and happiness in how he was developing and growing.  




Each time I try to make myself feel better, I ruin it.  I tell myself that it is possible all humans, animals have souls. I know there is no scientific proof right now (except for the Lanza theories which I am not sold on), but I feel it's possible for everyone to just have that essential spark in them. Then I feel better, but then realize that our consciousness is just our brains tricking us into thinking we are an ""I"" or we are a ""self."" That it's impossible for a soul to exist. Where in evolution would we even have developed one? What happened to all the beings in death who didn't have souls? Or were souls present in the primordial ooze we came from? See, that's just not realistic.  I look up stuff online which just confirms this bleakness. There's no hope anymore. Pre-Atenolol me wouldn't have thought these thoughts. Now I'm destroyed by them. Now I'm just thinking that every memory I make, every experience I have is for nothing. 




I just want to go back to my happy, silly, proud self. Is this all just the medicine? I want to take pride in my family again. I want the little things to become important again. I want to be carefree and hopeful again. However, I feel now that I've gotten a glimpse of the dark and painful truths of our existence that I'm going to never be able to get over this crisis, never get these thoughts out of my head, and never be happy again for the rest of my life. This terrifies me. I just want to be who I was again, but it think that's impossible.

487,CMV: intellectual property is property in name only,TRUE,1,t3_3ex1vr,"Theft: copying something can't possibly be theft because theft requires taking something away and copying doesn't do that. 

Economic efficiency / average happiness: violating the individual rights to be unharmed and to not have property taken without permission (e.g. fines) while *pursuing* higher average happiness is immoral and impractical. For the plan to work, one would have to show that average happiness would increase and that the oppression inherent in the prohibition on commercial copying (taking into account the nature of the organization required to enforce that prohibition) would not outweigh the benefits; a calculation that seems to me impossible to make. What we do know for sure, if a prohibition on commercial copying is implemented, is that individual rights will be violated. 

Homesteading ideas / ownership extends to what we create: I have no problem with people owning their ideas. I don't suggest that they be extracted from their brain or deleted from their computer. Copying adds more of an idea, it doesn't take it away from its owner.

813,CMV: Calling rock/metal real music - but not Rap - is an ignorant biased white-centric viewpoint.,FALSE,0,t3_3c8a2r,"1 - There's nothing wrong with preferring one genre over another.  The problem is when people say one is a respectable form of music but the other isn't.

2 - I said ethnocentric and not racist.  I'm not saying they dislike black people.  Rather that their closed minded culturally.

I think both genres are legitimate music.  Both proved that music doesn't always have to be harmoic and smooth.  And it's hypocritical to say white-noise is music and black-noise isn't.  It's hypocritical to get offended whenever an old-timer or critic says Slayer isn't real music, and then make fun of a rapper like Lil Wayne because he comes from a different culture and makes different music as well.

629,CMV: It is morally wrong to eat animals.,FALSE,0,t3_3dsq9z,"I believe that as intelligent beings capable of moral reasoning, we have a serious obligation to not needlessly kill and eat animals.  Im my opinion, ignoring this moral obligation is very serious, on par with most other ""do not kill"" obligations we have in our lives.

I also believe that the logic of ""humans are smarter than animals, therefore it's ok to eat this [pig/cow/etc.]"" is flawed, because most humans would feel uncomfortable eating a comatose person or someone who is profoundly mentally retarded, and yet would consider it totally fine to eat a pig with more self-sufficiency and intelligence.

I believe the rationale approach to issues of meat morality is to ask the question ""Why *should* it be ok to kill animals and eat their meat?"" rather than ""Why shouldn't it?""

Most modern philosophers make the issue seem relatively conclusive, saying that eating meat is morally wrong. (With some edge cases, of course. Not many argue that there's nothing wrong with eating meat to save your life on a desert island.)

Reddit, what do you think?  Is there a morally justifiable reason all of us should be ok with eating meat?

1176,CMV: Tips at restaurants should not be based upon a percentage of the cost of the meal.,TRUE,1,t3_38xqia,"The old tipping debate. I generally side with those that want to end the mostly American practice of tipping about 20% percent of the cost of the meal. That may never happen.

What bothers me, is the idea that the server's time is as only as valuable as the cost of what's on the plate. If I get a $8 plate of eggs at Waffle House I am to tip about 2 dollars. If I am to get a $50 steak at the local trendy restaurant or steak house, I am to tip over $10? 

I understand that *generally* at a more expensive restaurant I will spend more time there making the servers work a longer time on my needs. And they are usually expected to be more knowledgeable about the menu. And the bus has to make thing look better and the bartender has to know more cocktails....

But it seems to me, the tipping tradition has propped up a non-egalitarian system where the young and attractive can rake in a decent pay check because expensive restaurants can be exclusive about hiring, and others, especially the older who probably did not really want to be stuck server their whole career, are left taking the 15% on my cheap dinner.

If I go in simply for a beer and a dessert, I try to tip above 50%. For ""affordable"" dinners I try to tip 25-30%. For nicer dinners I usually end up tip 15-20%. Truly bad service and I will only tip 10-15%. And if they have a truly helpful suggestion at that trendy restaurant I may tip over 20%.....

I think we should move to a system based more on how long you are in the restaurant, and the amount of attention your visit actually needed, rather than a simple percentage completely isolated from the nuance of the service.

But the whole system just makes me feel guilty.",1176,TRUE,,TRUE,1
561,CMV: No closely related sports are any more difficult than the other,TRUE,1,t3_3ees72,"People often time have discussions on what sport is harder between baseball/softball, football/rugby and so on. 
However isn't every advantage that may make the sport easier a disadvantage to the opposing team?
Example:(When in comparison to softball) ""Baseball is much more difficult since the ball is smaller thus so much harder to hit"" 
Though isn't that an advantage to the pitcher?

The opposite goes for softball while the ball may be easier to hit since it is larger than a baseball, that makes it more difficult for the pitcher to succeed.

1261,CMV: Population decline is a good thing.,FALSE,0,t3_37y9hl,"Population decline is talked about as something negative. Countries like Japan as an example, have a large old population and not enough young people to ""replace"" them. The argument is that they must increase childbirth and increase immigration to sustain the economy. This is true for many countries. Another country where I live, Sweden. Here one of the main arguments for mass immigration is that we have many old people and too few young people. So to maintain the economic growth rate and taxable income rate more people is needed.

I call bullshit. It's estimated 50% of all jobs will disappear by 2030 because of automation. Most of these are in labour and other areas where the majority of the workforce is located. There will have to be a complete change of the current system of wage slavery and perpetual growth must go. That's another issue however.

My point is it will be a good thing to have a small population, or at least not a growing one. A decreasing population is the most sustainable for what's to come in the future.

(I'm making this about population size and not immigration per say, thanks.)

94,CMV: Direct democracy is more sustainable than representative democracy.,FALSE,0,t3_3i8h50,"My main points against representative democracy are:

* People vote for their own interests, and representatives are no different.

* At some point(probably due to the accumulation of too much money in too few hands) the desires of the smaller group of representatives clash with the desires of the many. People get fed up with living under plutocracies that they feel they can't trust.

* If democracy is a scale from 1-100, where that's a percentage of who gets to vote, so a dictatorship would probably be 0.000029%, and representative democracy might be 0.05%, then it implies that people who are partial towards democracy would prefer the ideal state of 100% democracy. If you prefer less than 100%, then you inherently think *some people don't deserve to have their desires represented*, and are by definition against the ideas of democracy.

* There isn't a practical selection process whereby we could choose people to do what's best for others. A meritocracy is unachievable, because there is no good process to select them. Which leads us to --&gt;

* If we think that people are smart enough to elect representatives, why are they not smart enough to vote on legislation directly?

* Participation in sites like reddit prove that people want direct democracy; which in government would be the ability to create and vote on legislation as if it were a post. 

Which is why representative democracies everywhere seem to have devolved into plutocracies. People are getting fed up with it, and starting to support non-establishment candidates or parties.

Which is exactly what we're seeing, in new political parties like the pirate party, podemos, syriza, which all tend toward direct democracy. Even countries without strong direct democracy movements, are having candidates trending in that direction: bernie sanders and jeremy Corbyn. 


It seems inevitable that our governmental systems trend from power being concentrated in one person, to becoming more decentralized. If autocracy is at one end, and direct democracy is at the other, then representative democracy lies somewhere in the imperfect middle.

TL:DR; People get fed up when the desires of their representatives clash with their own, and revolt against any concentration of power.

1269,CMV: Apples are better than oranges,TRUE,1,t3_37ven4,"You always hear the saying, ""it's like comparing apples and oranges,"" in a way that implies that it's silly to compare. This is false though and I would like the chance to prove to you that apples are the better, more versatile fruit.

Alcohol: drinking is awesome and fun. Rarely do you hear about anything orange though, outside of being a garnish or in liquers. Apples are the full feature alcohol fruit that can come in cider or wine form, as well and being used in the same fashions oranges could, liquers and garnishes. No one orders an orange wine because they just aren't common, and that's because they aren't very good! Apple is even sometimes used in beer, albeit orange is more common for that.

Food: oranges are pretty good for food, salads sauces and such, but what about an orange pie? As an American the apple pie is a quintessential food associated with America. That may not sway non Americans, with that I say, what about pork? You don't put an orange in a pigs mouth when you roast it, nope that's an apple. Both can be used in a variety of ways, but pie and pork gives apple the advantage.

Diversity: apples have over 7,000 varieties, oranges don't even come close to that. 

Juice: both make fine juices, but apple has far more variety to create a wide appeal. Apple juice also comes in carbonated form commonly. That's pretty cool.

Pop culture: the technology company Apple owes most of it's success because of the apple, spwcifically McIntosh apples. If macs were called ""Navels"" or ""Valencia"" instead would Apple have been so successful? Not a chance orange fans, sorry to burst your bubble. Also Forrest Gump's infamous line, ""life is like a crate of apples..."" Would never work with oranges due to lack of variety. Lastly, there's no Johnny Orangeseed, check and mate.

Love to hear orange fans change my mind though, let's see it.

1517,CMV: Reddit would be better without karma.,FALSE,0,t3_35ge2a,"I know that /r/changemyview requires I add a few points here, but I don't really have anything besides this perception that every single thing reddit users complain about stems from karma. Reposting, karma whoring, overused memes, etc. People do it because they want attention, and karma allows them that attention. It feels like everything is about getting people to like what you say rather than allowing people to speak their minds freely. It becomes a social status war about pleasing the masses. My views on this matter are similar to my views on allowing racist free speech. Most censorship, even user controlled censorship, is bad. Better to allow those views to come to light and then have a civil debate on it to change that person's view. Honestly, I just want a website that can be a forum for discussion without making me feel like an asshole for having unpopular opinions. So reddit may be a great place for the people who agree with the generally more popular opinions, but karma allows people to drown out the unpopular ones before they even have a chance to be defended. They shut down discussion and it de-incentivizes people who may have a different perspective. It should be okay to disagree, but it doesn't feel like it is unless you're in a sub specifically devoted to that. That's why the subs that prevent you from seeing karma are so great. You can have a reasoned discussion without feeling like you'll be punished for having a different opinion. Your comments get pushed to the bottom if you disagree with anything that doesn't fit with popular opinions. It's disgusting and it makes me want to abandon the site as a whole. I feel safer talking to real people who express genuine intelligence and do not take debate personally rather than those who attack you for having a different perspective. It applies to *everything* controversial and I think the subs that block karma are the ones who understand exactly what I'm talking about. The downvote button is not supposed to be a disagree button, but it is anyway. And that's a problem.
 
I guess I did have some reasoning lol hopefully it'll be enough to appease the mods...
 
But anyway, that's my view. I'm open to changing it, but keep in mind we may just have to agree to disagree. Which is okay with me, people are allowed to have different opinions. That's my entire point lol
 
I welcome you to try and CMV! :)
 
Edit: This view is mostly about comment karma and the system itself, not against a system of sorting the best content. As /u/RustyRook said, ""For a sub as popular and busy as [/r/Aww], it would be impossible for a user to view all the cuteness on offer."" So I understand and recognize that an invisible point system may be necessary, but my view is that it should never be a public aggregate number. It should only be an invisible way of sorting good content. I think comments are the bigger issue, and I think that people would be less likely to downvote unpopular opinions if there was less emphasis on karma.

731,CMV: We've gone way overboard lately with PC-ness and the Social Justice movement.,TRUE,1,t3_3cwzdr,"This may be surprising to some if you look at my history on this sub, where I posted several CMVs critical of Gamergate, the police and conservatives, but here goes... we've gone way overboard with this PC/Social Justice mentality.

Recent examples are-

-the furor this morning (at least on twitter) over Amy Schumer in the WaPo. http://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/07/06/dont-believe-her-defenders-amy-schumers-jokes-are-racist/

-Hannibal Burress had a minor run-in with several notable female twitter personalities including Gaby Dunn. https://twitter.com/hannibalburess/status/618179591140564992 (there's a whole list of responses, if it doesn't show up just go through his timeline)

-Jerry Seinfeld made news when he said he wouldn't play college campuses anymore, to much reminding of his relationship with a 17-year old twenty years ago, and snickering over how his material isn't even edgy anyway. http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/10/living/seinfeld-comedy-colleges-feat/

-Chris Rock said the same thing last year. I guess he's a shitlord too. http://www.vulture.com/2014/11/chris-rock-frank-rich-in-conversation.html

-Patton Oswalt, who at one point was booed in Philly for his anti-Bush beliefs back during 2004 or so, is now not worthy of being followed. He's in a category with Trump and Palin. http://www.dailydot.com/opinion/patton-oswalt-twitter-troll-unfollow/

-Not to pick on Gaby Dunn, but earlier this year she blew up at Josh Groban, because I guess young male celebrities being horndogs is completely new and has never, ever happened in human history. https://storify.com/amandataylor88/don-t-fall-for-this-famous-guy-s-flattery

Hell, even amongst the more notable far-left twitter there's infighting. Suey Park and Lauren Chief Elk are going at it over DMs to an ex/stolen laptops https://twitter.com/suey_park/status/617747933987889152

And depending on who you believe, Rania Khalek is anti-black http://bad-dominicana.tumblr.com/post/87992874258/rania-khalek-such-an-antiblack-piece-of-shit-like or ""bad_dominacana"" is racist against Arabs https://twitter.com/raniakhalek/status/514920026236018688.

I was, am and will be a dyed-in-the-patchouli liberal. I was ecstatic that gays can get married now. I will call Caitlyn Jenner whatever SHE wants me to. I'm a big fan of Bernie Sanders. I absolutely believe all fortysomething of Bill Cosby's accusers.
That said, I'm starting to feel a little lost. I cringe when I see the word ""thinkpiece."" I hate that people get so caught up in a perpetual outrage machine and so high off their own self-righteousness they will destroy a life like Justine Sacco's (http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/magazine/how-one-stupid-tweet-ruined-justine-saccos-life.html?_r=0) for sport. (Also, how great is Sam Biddle for basically admitting he'd do it all over again for ""the clickz?"") I have to believe that the right or, ""The Man,"" are absolutely loving this infighting. Endless digital ink is spilled on Black Widow in The Avengers while cops are still shooting anyone with a skin tone darker than Burnt Sienna.

Am I wrong? Am I the asshole here? Is all of this of vital importance? Will the 24/7/365 internet analytical news cycle bring us to the promised land? Or is this just a tool of cultural commentators on a deadline?

EDIT:  I'll add this since I'm getting a lot of advice to get off twitter.  I definitely don't go on as much as I used to, but it's hard for me to stay off completely for two reasons.  One, there's a lot of actually good, funny twitterers out there.  It's also a good news source, it's how I found out we got Bin Laden.  Two, as someone who, despite all warning signs, wants to be involved someday in the comedy/entertainment biz, it's kinda necessary for those on the come up to use it as a promotional tool.  If I was Spielberg or Tarantino I'd get the hell off, trust me.  But I'm a nobody from nowhere at the moment.

Try not to focus on the Twitter thing as much.  There's pieces on Gawker, WaPo and Daily Dot that I've used for examples.  Here's a piece on the AVClub where the writer complains about female fans of Captain Marvel for... reasons.  Not sure.  They're problematic somehow.

http://www.avclub.com/article/marvel-learned-wrong-lessons-carol-corps-218003

EDIT 2:  Not sure how much longer this'll stay active, or how much I'll be able to check in tomorrow so I'll do a pseudo-wrap up here.  I used mainly examples from the comedy world and Twitter since that's what immediately came to mind.  Other examples I could've used were Donglegate (http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/03/how-dongle-jokes-got-two-people-fired-and-led-to-ddos-attacks/) and ScientistShirtgate (http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2014/11/18/scientist-shirt-feminism-comet-your-say/19248543/).  I think those two, and there are others, are also worthy of discussion in that they involve nuance.  Someone like Donald Trump, that's a black-and-white case of racism.  

Someone in the comments said this seemed like neurotic hand-wringing by an alienated individual, and that could very well be the case.  I didn't really spend a whole lot of time making a comprehensive essay about this because a-it's just reddit and b-I posted from the gut with immediacy.  If someone wants to take this theme and do it up better, by all means go for it.  I never claimed to be a social scientist.  Or even just social.

Some good opinions here, with the major consensus being that these things seem big and important on the internet where everything is a hot take and people are either Lawful Good or Chaotic Evil with no in-between.  So in stepping out from the cyberspace will keep the perspective in check.

Good talk everyone!  No name calling or trolling!

772,CMV: Remote Work is the way of the future. Companies that offer little or no remote work options have an ethical obligation to explore and implement remote working flexibility for their knowledge workers.,FALSE,0,t3_3ck2mj,"The office as we know it is a relic from a time before internet and the digital tools to work, plan, and collaborate from any location with an internet connection.

Most office jobs are already done on a computer connected to the internet, with email and different business applications. Business workflows that still involve physical papers in an office usually exist not because there isn't a complete digital solution on the market to replace and streamline the process, but that an effort to research and implement that solution has not yet been prioritized.

A great deal of office communication is done by email or over the phone. Communication which is done in person usually stems not from necessity, but social instincts from being obliged against your wishes to share a physical space during a certain time of the day as a condition for employment. If employees want to see each other during meetings or one-on-one conversations, there are tools like Skype to do that.

When office jobs only include work  that can be accomplished anywhere with a laptop and internet access, and necessitate communication that can all be accomplished through email, phone, webcam, that job has the capability to be done completely (or at least partially with little exception) remotely.

To accept this premise about most office jobs, and to agree that a great majority of people would be fully willing and extremely happy about the flexibility to do some or all of their work from home or a location of their own choosing, I am left to conclude that businesses with these jobs have an ethical obligation on the part of owners and upper management to dedicate as much working time as necessary (that doesn't interfere with the company's livliehood) to researching and implementing a flexible remote work option for all personell completely or partially capable of performing their duties from any location with phone and internet access.

In 2015, company owners, directors, and mangement in a position to implement remote working flexibility for their employees that refuse to do so are probably lazy at best, and at worst are also abusing their leverage as the employer in a job market by persisting the now archaic model of the office, and are being inconsiderate towards possibly increasing their employee's happiness exponentially.

EDIT: There's been a lot of good discussion here, and I am convinced to add that reluctance to adopt remote work options is not limited to laziness. It can also come from stubbornness or aprehension on the part of management, particularly when it consists of baby boomers, or a belief that adopting a fully remote work plan will have negative impacts. I still maintain that employers should feel some sense of obligation to at least explore the topic and come to an informed opinion on what remote work options can be offered at their company.",772,TRUE,,TRUE,1
622,"CMV: The term ""white trash"" is racist to every race but whites",FALSE,0,t3_3dxn2g,"Warning you now, I use some hefty racial slurs in my explanation. I'm not racist and don't support the use of any of these terms, but I'm going to use them here as examples. 

Now I'm not one for overly ""SJW""-like thinking, and I'm not personally outraged by the term, but I'm floored by how rarely I see anyone realize or even acknowledge that the term is racist. The phrasing ""white trash"" assumes that white people are inherently not trash and that this is a special exemption to the rule and needs to be labeled as such. One doesn't say ""black nigger"" or ""mexican spic"", the hate is built into the word itself. The word *is* the hate label. Having to specify ""white"" before your insult just makes it seem like it's shocking to you that a white person is behaving abnormally. Like they're a weird example of a white person instead of just another white person in a sea of different examples.

Now, I've heard the arguments before that ""there's no good word to throw at white people"" and ""I use the term and I'm not racist"". Neither of these are valid points. A lack of a ""good"" insult doesn't make a bad one ""good"" and your feelings on the matter have no bearing on the reality of how the term is constructed.

I'm not saying people who use the term are racists, I just think they don't realize the implication. Every time I bring this up though I'm downvoted without explanation. The score will drop but I'll hear no hint of rebuttal, which has convinced me I'm right but I'm just saying something they don't like. But hey idk, maybe I'm totally wrong. I'm willing to hear it. CMV?

**Edit**: Wow there's a lot more here than I anticipated, sorry if I don't respond to everyone! ^^^(even ^^though ^^any ^^time ^^I ^^say ^^anything ^^it's ^^like ^^it's ^^on ^^fire ^^and ^^downvotes ^^are ^^water.)

I have probably done a poor job of accurately representing my stance on the issue. In an effort to drive home my logic, I was a little extreme with my phrasing. I will concede that the use of the term isn't insulting to other races, but I think it does hint at the ""white people are normally higher class"" sentiment that fuels the entire phrase. If you find that *INSULTING/TRIGGERING* or not probably has more to due with you than the phrase but as /u/ratherenjoysbass said in the comments: 

""I think white trash is fucked up in that it inherently assumes that most white people are successful, well-mannered people so we must delineate the people that did not make it as well, for some reason couldn't afford enough class, or are the genetic unwanted when compared to the rest of the white race. Most other racial slurs inherently include the entire race so even a white person saying white trash is still acknowledging racial superiority against the others.""

283,CMV: USA was unjustified in bombing Japan to hasten the end of World War 2. The government of USA should apologize from the nation of Japan.,TRUE,1,t3_3ggp32,"Why I hold this view:

1.  America can't ever be considered to be justified in using atomic bombs to end a war. Those bombs were dropped on cities full of innocent civilians, women and children. People with real lives, they were emotional sentient beings; not a statistical number. There had to be some other way than decimating two civilian cities just because we want to end a war quickly.

2. Osama Bin Laden and Al-Qaeda executed a brutal plan to orchestrate the 9/11 attacks. [According to them, their major motivation was to end the presence of US in gulf countries and other motives as well.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks#Motives) For this purpose they chose to ram airplanes in the WTC  &amp; Pentagon to achieve maximum civilian casualties and make a frightening spectacle for the US public. The ends justify the means seems to be their reasoning. Was Al-Qaeda &amp; Co justified in perpetrating 9/11? 
No one would say yes.

     If we observe the reasoning of US generals behind the nuclear bombing to end World War 2, we can see some parallels. Al-Qaeda and American Generals both used a method of causing mass casualties to drive a point across. They both used lives of innocent civilians as a statistic to further their respective causes. The atomic bombings caused 246,000+ casualties (not taking into account the deaths caused later by radiation exposure and cancer. 9/11 caused 3000 deaths. 


3. Civilians VS Army: If you believe that the ends justify the means, then dropping the bomb may seem justified. But then you also agree that civilian casualties are fair game to drive a point across. Army is a different thing. A soldier agrees to the dangers of war and hardship for the protection of their nation. They agree to the fact that they may not return alive from a war. A civilian is a different case, their involvement in a war is very remote. To slaughter innocent civilians just because it will hasten the end of a war seems unjustified. Many people hold the viewpoint that the US bombing was in retaliation of Pearl Harbour. But the Japanese attacked a naval base, they did not bomb a hospital or a school did they? If we agree that the end justify the means then logically we have to say that Al-Qaeda was kind of justified to cause 9/11 as well.

4. The argument of USA that the bombing saved more lives compared to Operation Downfall, in the long term, is wrong. Because at least the lives of innocent civilians would have been spared. How do we even know the outcome of Operation Downfall? Moreover Japan was nearly close to surrendering anyway as the Secretary Of War, Henry Louis Stimson agreed: 

“Japan had no allies; its navy was almost destroyed; its islands were under a naval blockade; and its cities were undergoing concentrated air attacks.”


We erased two cities and its people from history. We dehumanized them, reduced them to a statistic. W[e even censored images and stories of the Japanese victims to push the narrative in our direction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki#Depiction.2C_public_response_and_censorship). At least the Government should officially apologize to the nation of Japan.

628,CMV: Drones used as weapons to kill should be banned just like chemical and biological agents are.,TRUE,1,t3_3dsxwj,"War is never pretty, nor should it be taken lightly, but all this talk about 'the war of the future' being fought with robots and remote control drones is just inhumane, in both uses of the term. yes It takes humans off the front lines, and saves their lives, but it makes for a one sided battle, with heavy casualties on the other side. That's all fine and good when it's ""the good guys"" using them to stop the ""bad guys"", but look at the other side. flying machines that can be sent anywhere at any time to shoot and bomb targets. If you shoot one down, there is no victory, they just send more, with no real loss because the pilot is miles away in a tent with a joystick. 

If both sides end up with drone technology, war will just revert into guerrilla style ambush style attacks, with both sides sending drones to attack the other sides bases, cities and civilians.  


all the positive reasons for using drones are equally valid when used as a negative reason.

Chem and Bio weapons are banned because they cause mass casualties with very little risk to the side using them, and the opposition can't really fight back against it. Drones are the same.

1365,"CMV: Ads on Hulu are no different from ads we've gotten on cable TV for decades, and people who complain about it are just spoiled.",TRUE,1,t3_36p7k9,"This is something that I just have such a hard time understanding.  For years we have been stuck with having cable or satellite subscriptions that are overly priced and force you to pay for large bundles of channels that you might not even want.  Streaming services like Hulu and Netflix have offered a great way to circumvent that process at a much more affordable price and are completely changing the way we view content.

And yet I still see so many people getting so wound up over watching ads on Hulu.  My perception of their argument is this: ""I pay for Hulu, so I shouldn't have to see ads.""  Maybe I'm over-simplifying it, but I just haven't seen any other viable argument that really says anything beyond that.

Now, I should say I definitely understand hating ads.  I live in the city, and I can't walk ten feet out my door without someone trying to sell me something.  We are over-saturated by advertising and it's awful.  Thankfully with more options to block advertising on the internet, it's forcing advertisers to create ads that are more entertaining and feel less obtrusive (although, sometimes it does also force the opposite).

But even though I hate advertising as much as a lot of people do, I still recognize it as a vital part of what makes television work, and since I really like being able to know what happens on my favorite shows every week, I don't get my panties in a twist over it.

I see a lot of people getting wound up who have little understanding of how a service like Hulu works.  I'm certainly not an expert either, but I have an understanding of how the licensing process works and how expensive it can be.  Netflix may be able to get by without ads, but Hulu offers something that Netflix doesn't: content from television that is current and has recently aired.

Netflix usually won't provide new episodes of a show until an entire season is finished.  And even then, it might be a few months until even that happens.  The only current content they do have is their own original programming, which they can get away with because they own the licenses and don't have to pay any licensing fees or performance royalties to any outside production company.

I've seen a lot of my favorite shows on Hulu have episodes be online just hours after it airs on live TV.  Since I dropped cable years ago, this is one of my favorite things about it.  I don't necessarily like that advertising is part of my subscription, but I also realize that Hulu has to license this content from production companies, who have had a history of being apprehensive when it comes to embracing changing technologies.  They are likely charging much higher licensing fees and royalties which means that Hulu in turns has to find other sources of income beyond subscription fees in order to make it work.  Not to mention that the networks themselves probably have their own fees since they probably have exclusivity deals with the production companies who make the programming.

People are so quick to jump to the ""X company is a bunch of greedy corporate whores"" argument without understand the major complexities that go into making a service like Hulu work.  I'm sure Hulu is well aware that their subscribers don't like watching ads.  ""I don't like watching ads"" is even an option in their survey when you cancel your account.  People went on the same tirade when Netflix raised its prices, and I remember thinking the same thing then.

I think that people's displeasure with advertising will ultimately shift services in the direction of removing advertising, but I still think that's a long way off.  Streaming services, despite being around for several years now, are still in their infancy in a lot of ways.  It's going to take a while to allow everyone to adapt and a lot of companies will be resistant to it in the hopes they can retain their old business models.  But I don't see any of this as the fault of Hulu for using advertising.

So my real curiosity here is to find an argument against Hulu's advertising that I haven't seen.  I see so many people upset about it, but I feel like my only understanding of their argument is that they're spoiled and don't want to see ads, which I recognize can be straw-manning on my part.  I'd like to see if someone can shift my bias and provide me some insight I'm not aware of.

EDIT: /u/ceader is the one who ultimately changed my view.  I'm still kind of skeptical about some people's criticisms towards Hulu, but I'm definitely more understanding of why people don't want to pay for ads.

Being a vegetarian is more expensive than eating meat. Therefore, you need to get this money from elsewhere.

So vegetarians are basically putting other species of animals above their own, which I would say is objectively bad.

56,CMV: One of the single most effective ways to reduce gun related homicide is to disarm front line police officers.,FALSE,0,t3_3imvz3,"I believe that the main incentive for carrying a firearm when committing a crime is that you may need to defend yourself against armed police.

Because criminals tend to be armed normal citizens need to be armed in order to protect themselves against those criminals.

Disarming the police would reduce the need for criminals to carry firearms and so generally reduce the perceived need to carry a gun by citizens.

By removing this normalcy of this type of weapon is reduced and a reduced rate of gun related homicide should be seen.

This is borne out in countries like the UK and applies specifically to guns rather than all non lethal arms.

When asked, UK police officers say overwhelmingly that they wish to remain unarmed.

A 2006 survey of 47,328 Police Federation members found 82% did not want officers to be routinely armed on duty, despite almost half saying their lives had been ""in serious jeopardy"" during the previous three years.

I feel like there is a backlash against immigration for multiple reasons, like racism, not immigrating well, and crimes. 

I feel that people might be more welcoming to asylumseekers if they are known to not be criminals, and that that causes both racism and not immigrating well to lessen.

On the other hand if you come to another country because you fear for your life, and know that you will be kicked out if you commit a crime then being a criminal is apparently so important to you, that the country would be completely justified in kicking you out.

776,CMV: Turning your head to check your blind spot is unsafe compared to alternatives,TRUE,1,t3_3chnd1,"I hate driving. One of the main reasons is (aside from being kind of a shitty driver myself), I feel like turning your head 135 degrees to check your blind spot is extremely dangerous, even though it's part of the standard procedure for changing into another lane. This is especially bad now that I've got a [Madza 3](http://images.newcars.com/images/car-pictures/original/2014-Mazda-Mazda3-Sedan-i-SV-4dr-Sedan-Photo-3.png), since the backseat windows are so high up that I have to crane my neck and can barely make out what's going on in my blind spot anyways. Also, having to turn my head to such a wide angle means there's a lot more time when my eyes aren't in front of me, on the road ahead.

I understand that it's absolutely essential to make sure there's nobody in your blind spot. But there's lots of solutions that allow you to use mirrors to check instead, among them being

- [adjusting your sideviews to incorporate the blind spot](http://www.caranddriver.com/features/how-to-adjust-your-mirrors-to-avoid-blind-spots)
- [buying one of these](http://www.amazon.com/Fit-System-C0400-Passenger-Adjustable/dp/B001DKT0DO/ref=sr_1_1?s=automotive&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1436313257&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=blind+spot+mirror)

Both of these options let you keep at least your peripheral vision on the road and greatly reduces the time it takes you check your blind spot.

Edit: Apparently, I've been doing it wrong the whole time. You guys are right, there shouldn't be any reason to take 2 seconds to do a shoulder check - I tend to scan the whole rear side of my car instead of looking at a specific spot.

885,CMV: The second amendment is not effective as protection against the government's tyranny,FALSE,0,t3_3blt1q,"I've seen many times the claim that guns help protect against the government getting out of hand. I don't find this argument persuasive for these reasons:

**The threat isn't effective:**

* For the argument to really work, guns must present an effective threat to the government, or at least to the politician introducing some sort of freedom restricting legislation. Just having the gun isn't enough, there must be a perception of that people are willing to use it.
* Guns are a weapon of last resort. To take arms against the government means a near guarantee that you'll sacrifice your life for it. This means it only makes sense if what the government is doing is so awful that death is an acceptable risk.
* To achieve success there needs to be a large amount of agreement that this is the right path. Until that, it'll simply be terrorism and opposed by the rest of the population.
* In fact, the actions of the US government don't seem to be especially careful when compared to the actions of say, an European government where gun ownership is restricted. So the threat doesn't seem to be working.

**There won't be a clear point at which to resort to weapons:**

* One path a government may take is to slowly reduce freedoms, in such a way that no single reduction warrants a violent response.
* The other path is to drastically reduce freedoms, at a time where the country seems to be under attack. The violent response will be prevented by patriotism.

**The results will be counterproductive:**

* By the speed with which things like the PATRIOT act and the TSA appeared it seems like there are laws and proposed organisms lying in wait for just the right incident. An attack against the government that doesn't have widespread public support will result in the swift reduction of freedoms, using the attack as the perfect excuse for it. And the public will support it.
* The American public is deeply patriotic and any such attacks won't get a positive reception, even despite the people having a serious distrust and lack of faith in the government.

**The willingness to fight will be neutralized:**

* A government changing to a tyranny, unless it's completely stupid, will do so with an amount of care and will try to ensure its own success.
* A slow introduction of surveillance and restrictions will be able to push back the willingness to fight and undermine any forming resistance. Already existing laws and mechanisms can be used to sabotage such efforts.
* If a resistance is forming anyway, a government may make just enough concessions to avoid a revolution.

**My conclusion:**

Guns as a way of protecting against the government overstepping its bounds aren't effective until things really get out of hand. By that point, there isn't really any freedom left to protect.

512,"CMV: In the 21st century western world, both genders have pros and cons and hence one is not more oppressed",FALSE,0,t3_3erm7n,"I know this might be considered a low hanging fruit, and let me know if it is, but I have a friend who is overall very intelligent, yet this is something we argue about once in a while and I was hoping for some opinions that we can read together and come to a conclusion. I've noticed these arguments occur with many people who consider themselves feminist (actual not tumblr). 

Personally I believe that there are issues with treatment of both genders. Women have higher rates of rape outside prison, a very small but statistically significant pay gap (~95:100), stricter standards of beauty, some discrimination in STEM fields in professional environments, general treatment at skill levels, domestic violence rates, sex ed in certain regions, Madonna/Whore complex treatment, etc. I also believe men have issues such as higher rates of workplace injuries and death, PTSD due to higher enlisting rates, treatment towards mental health issues, homelessness, mate selection, physical violence, university enrolment and graduation rates, punishment for the same crime, paternity and divorce issues, etc.

In the end I don't believe that one gender has a clear advantage over the other. I believe that both genders have issues they face in modern society, and to quantify them would take away from the struggles of either. Hence despite agreeing on many points with feminism, I would not be considered a feminist because I don't agree with the core belief that women are the oppressed gender. This seems to bother my friend who feels strongly about feminism, because despite the fact that we agree on many points, that one distinction is not something we agree on. He finds it insulting that I would compare out-of-prison rapes to something like PTSD from war in terms of statistics of percentage occurring to each gender. Personally I find it shitty because he doesn't acknowledge that men have some serious issues as well, and no one gender is undoubtedly superior in the eyes of society. 

In many other parts of the world, I agree with him 100%; women are significantly more oppressed in many Islamic countries for example.

1129,"CMV: Sometimes, the idea of being transgender perpetuates heteronormative society, and less people would consider themselves transgender if we didn't restrict people based on gender.",TRUE,1,t3_39ejy5,"Hi Reddit. With all the news over the past couple weeks regarding Caitlyn Jenner’s transition and coming out, I feel now is a good time to discuss gender’s role in society and its position in how people identify as an individual. I would like to preface myself by saying that I identify as a pansexual cis-male, and I certainly have zero issues with people that are transgendered. I do, however, get very confused as to *why* some people are transgendered.


Many people use the phrase, “I am a male trapped in a female’s body,” or, “my body is male but my brain is female.” What does this even mean? From a very young age, people are raised with ideas imposed upon us that dictate what boys are and what girls are, and these perceptions have nothing to do with the biological sex of someone and are typically based upon baseless stereotypical personality traits or what that gender should like to do. We are taught boys should play with toy cars and tools while girls are supposed to like barbies and dresses. These stereotypes are completely disparate from the reality that people are often multi-faceted, and might like many things across several disciplines and across several “gender” boundaries. I, personally, love to wrench my own car, build things, and in the same day I might decide to look totally different and wear makeup as an artistic outlet or go out shopping with friends to look at heels. These interests have nothing to do with my biological sex, and shouldn’t have an affect on how I identify.


Society has dictated that girls do certain things and boys do certain things. What does this mean when someone who is anatomically male tends to like a lot of the things that the opposite gender stereotypically likes? I think it’s unfair to oneself to say, “I like girl things so therefore I’m a girl,” or, “I like looking like a girl so I’m a girl.” This idea of outward presentation equating to one’s gender identity seems restrictive to me. I question how many people would identify as transgender if these societal norms became antiquated and everyone was truly free to express all sides of themselves regardless of physical sex. It should not be odd to be a very “feminine” person (makeup, hair, dress, etc) and be anatomically male and identify as a male despite one’s outward aesthetic. There shouldn’t even be an emphasis in society as to what gonads someone possesses. I believe far less people would identify as transgender, especially considering some people that are transgendered do not want sexual reassignment surgery, if we, as a society, were more open minded about individuality instead of trying to group people together based on their gender. If one doesn’t even want to have SRS, but they want to live their life “as a wo/man,” how is this not simply perpetuating the heteronormative ideologies imposed upon us? One shouldn’t have to explain to society who they are with their gender just because they don’t fit into the false dichotomy of male/female.

198,CMV: Many Parents Have a Lop-Sided Reaction to People Mentioning the Joys of Not Having Children,FALSE,0,t3_3h9ljy,"I've noticed this in person, but it is even more apparent on reddit. Almost anywhere on reddit, if there is a comment that gets popular that mentions something good about not having children or something bad about having children it seems there will soon be people replying stuff like ""Geez, apparently all of the child haters are out on reddit today."" I find this to be an oddly aggressive pushback considering parents often spend a huge amount of time advertising to others exactly how amazing their children are.

To a certain degree, I think I can understand why this might be. It is kind of like getting a tattoo. Being a parent is something that only goes one direction. Unless you're willing to be practically socially ostracized, then once you have a child there is no going back. So just like getting a tattoo, people suddenly become much more aggressive about defending the practice in the face of even mild disagreement.

This also reminds me of a similar problem with religious belief. Where people will share their deepest religious convictions in public and make definitive statements about how the universe works and then respond with an out-sized reaction when someone posts something about how they don't really think any of that makes much sense.",198,FALSE,,FALSE,0
159,CMV: There is more genetic variation within human populations than there is between. Therefore classification of humans into 'races' is meaningless.,FALSE,0,t3_3hknzy,"Quite a controversial topic. However due to scientific evidence I'm convinced that there is more genetic variation within human populations than there is between.

However I've spoken with some interesting characters who are convinced there is evidence to believe that there are quite large differences between so called human 'races' and they therefore think this is a justification for lets say 'proto-racism'.

For many years now they have made it compulsory to register, however measures such as these seem to be highly ineffective globally at getting an increased turnout in elections, not just NZ. There was less than a 5% increase in voting in the last election despite it being a far more prominent election due to the kim dot com saga. National, our right wing party won so promisingly they were able to not form a coalition with other groups (this is almost unheard of in NZ). Many of my peers did not vote, nor did I as we believed that john key was a poor choice for a leader, but there was a lack of any leader that appealed to this group of 10 of us. We all agreed at the time that if there was a vote that had no significance in the election other than to measure those people who do not believe we have any valid current person running for prime minister we would not only have a higher turnout at the election with little effort, but we'd also have a better idea of what the general perception was on the stability of the political scene. This would help us to build a better political scene long term and involve the voter, ultimately resulting in higher voting turnout at a fraction of the cost or social effort and would result in a better turnout. This would theoretically apply globally too, as in countries such as the US it could be used to show many things, not just the (lack of) confidence in either leader, but also other things.

Implementation might be a challenge but it could easily be overcome and the benefits would well outweigh the costs and implementation efforts",227,FALSE,,FALSE,0
1247,"CMV: Being quick to anger and violence is a mental illness or disability, and we should be more proactive about getting it treated if we see its symptoms, and preventing it occurring",FALSE,0,t3_3822j7,"Often in life, and on the internet, I see people who see violence or anger on a personal level (I would rather not discuss things like wars or gang violence, which have other issues in play) as a solution or immediate reaction to a problem. On a personal level, I cannot fathom how such a person could reach adulthood without being institutionalised or requiring severe therapy in order to control these emotions.  

Our emotions *inform* our actions, but they should never *control* them. I might get irritated at being cut off in traffic, but I would never start cursing out and gesticulating at the driver in front of me - because I rationally know that this will have zero effect in correcting the problem currently being faced. I might get pissed off when I start losing an online game, but I don't start abusing other players, or physically breaking my computer or punching a wall - because that would result in me materially losing, not gaining. So such a person who *does* do such a thing should be considered mentally disabled or ill, as they are taking actions that don't benefit them for only the most minor of catharsis - it's just another flavour of self-harm.  

A simple Google search of ""anger mental illness"" backs up my views, with many anger-related mental health issues. It's even in the public consciousness, with movies like *Anger Management*. Yet somehow, domestic violence continues to be a problem - so somehow, these mentally ill people aren't being caught and somehow believe that violence is ever an acceptable response in an adult life. Even shouting matches still occur despite the fact that any rational adult should be able to carry out a calm conversation and either keep themselves under control, or withdraw if they feel they cannot.   

So the short version of the CMV is: Being quick or accepting of violence and anger is already partially recognised as a mental disability/illness, but we're not doing enough to combat it. As a global society, we should be more active in teaching children that it's literally never OK in standard adult life (self-defence being the only exception), and if we ever see it in adults, we should be quick to recommend them to therapy in the long-term, and ask them why they feel anger/violence is acceptable in the short term when any sane person would know it's the wrong thing to do.

733,CMV: The assumption that alien life exists is wildly optimistic,FALSE,0,t3_3cvas1,"Its pretty common to encounter people, including a decent number of reputable astrophysicists, who believe that the odds of life existing on other planets are so high as to be a near-certainty. These assumptions, as far as I can tell, tend to be based on the size and age of the universe (i.e. huge and old), particularly the number of ""earth-like"" planets.

But its my understanding that in fact knowing exactly how ""earth-like"" a planet is is pretty difficult, and that many planets listed as ""earth-like"" may not actually be earth-like in enough of the ways that matter--in other words, just because a planet is roughly earth-sized, roughly the right distance from a sun, and features heavy elements, doesn't actually mean that it in any way is earth-like *enough* to support life. In fact, it is entirely possible that planets which can support life are vanishingly rare, much rarer than most estimates based on ""earth-like"" planets seem to acknowledge.

In addition, the odds that a planet which does meet earth-like criteria actually will develop life are basically totally unknown--anthropic bias and the fact that we literally only have only one model planet to observe makes actually nailing down the odds of abiogenesis on some other, non-earth planet very difficult to estimate. And while it is true that abiogenesis seems to have occured roughly soon after conditions on earth met the necessary preconditions as we understand them, it is also my understanding that as far as we can tell abiogenesis only happened once on earth, with all life on earth ultimately stemming from a common origin. If abiogenesis were really common once the necessary preconditions were met, why hasn't it kept happening?

TL;DR I think most estimates of the number of planets which actually meet the necessary conditions for abiogenesis (rather than just being broadly earth-like), and for the likelihood of abiogenesis occuring once conditions have been met, are very possibly way too high, and that it is just as likely if not moreso that both planets which can support life and abiogenesis on such planets are infinitesimally rare. While I would never say with 100% certainty that alien life does not exist, I am unconvinced by those who say it almost certainly does.

1404,CMV: I believe that abortion is morally wrong.,FALSE,0,t3_36esas,"To open, I'd like to say that I am nonreligious and pro-choice.


I believe that abortion is wrong from an objective standpoint. I believe that, no matter what, a fetus is a living being, and that it is wrong to kill it. I understand that some people do not have the means to care for a child, but adoption is, in most developed countries, an option. I believe that life is an innate, inalienable human right, and that stealing it from another is wrong.


I feel as though pregnancies conceived through rape are still deserving of life and should not pay for the sins of the father, however, I find it much more easy to emphasize and sympathize with women who choose to terminate  said pregnancies.


I'd be more than happy to have my view change, but I've never encountered an argument that could do so. Mostly, it seems to boil down to pedantics revolving around whether or not a fetus is a living being or just part of the mother, which I don't find to be a point of debate- even if it isn't ""alive"" right now, it *will* be, so one way or another you are killing it.

428,CMV: Learning a second language (beyond English) isn't worth it for most people anymore.,TRUE,1,t3_3fben2,"Translation software already exists and is pretty good. Image recognition lets you translate signs, and with voice recognition, it may be possible to have a conversation between two people who don't share a language (although it would be slow and occasionally confusing). Google translate may have its hiccups, but I can understand the majority of its translations and it's only going to get better over the next few years.

I understand that most universities (at least in the US) require some time spent in a foreign language class, but this is really part of what I am arguing against. Most people I have ever taken a foreign language class with resented being there and putting in years of effort to learn a skill they might only use a couple times in their whole life, and will likely forget.

Obviously people in some careers, like diplomats or aid workers, need to learn another language, but I just don't see how the average person will spend enough time with people who don't speak their language, in a place without an interpreter or internet access, to justify the amount of time spent learning a language.

*I am excepting English from this because so much of the Internet is available only in English.

**Edit**: /u/RustyRook changed my view by linking a study which showed that learning a language could delay onset of dementia by 4.5 years. To me, this would justify the time requirement as it often doesn't take that long to learn a language.

1143,CMV: Bernie Sanders idea of free college doesn't seem like a good thing.,FALSE,0,t3_39anx4,"This is probably because I am really bad at understanding politics and don't totally know what Sanders wants to do.  

But the money for free college would come from taxes, correct?  Does that mean that taxes would get raised or that he would just alter around the spending the government does?  Because if taxes are going to get raised that means I have to pay for my own loans that are going to take 10 years plus extra taxes so people can go for free?  That is not fair and while it seems nice, I don't have the money for that.  Nor, I'm sure, do most Americans.  

And what happens with private institutions?  Does that mean through my taxes I am paying for someone to go a $60,000 school when I couldn't go to one myself because I couldn't afford it?  Maybe that seems selfish, but that does not seem fair.  And the government should not be able to force me to pay so other people can get an easier life when I myself did not get that chance.  By the way, I know I am already being forced to pay for things I don't want, but shouldn't we be trying to lessen those instances instead of adding to them?

I mean, on paper his idea sounds great.  Free college, a better educated America, a more economically even country. YAY.  But that doesn't come for free.  And just because I am finally out of school and making a semi-decent wage doesn't mean I should have to pay for other people.  I guess that means I am anti-socialism?  Is there maybe any other way that this could be accomplished?  Like just lessening the cost of college somehow instead of totally free?

1274,"CMV: I think viewing child pornography should be legal, because it results in fewer children being victims of sexual abuse.",TRUE,1,t3_37u0y6,"Before I continue, I would like to start by saying that I am not a pedophile and that I am strongly against the sexual abuse of children. 

My view is based on scientific evidence which strongly suggests that allowing pedophiles to view child porn will result in fewer instances of sexual abuse.

Now I understand and accept that some people will say that children who feature in child porn are re-victimised when they learn that people are viewing images of their abuse, but by legalising viewing, this would mean that the victims will never learn that images of their abuse are being viewed and so they will not suffer re-victimisation. 

There is no evidence to suggest that pedophiles who view child porn are more likely than not to go onto abuse children. In fact, the research suggests the exact opposite. It suggests that pedophiles who have access to child porn are more likely than not to stick with child porn to relieve their desires rather than abuse a child. 

My view is based on a study titled [""Legalizing child pornography is linked to lower rates of child sex abuse""](https://www.springer.com/about+springer/media/springer+select?SGWID=0-11001-6-1042321-0).

Child abuse is abhorrant, but I think to ignore this research is irresponsible. 

I will not be convinced by anecdotal evidence on this by the way. Please make sure you provide reliable sources for your opinions, like I have. 

CMV.

Edit: Someone has suggested that I make it clear that I am only talking about the viewing of child porn to be legal and not the production or distribution of images.

335,CMV: The United States will never have a multi-party system within my lifetime.,FALSE,0,t3_3g1qjg,"As a young American who will be able to vote in his first election in 2016, I have an unorthodox set of political views, and somewhat fluid ones at that. I subscribe to [progressive](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheYoungTurks), [libertarian](https://www.youtube.com/user/ReasonTV), and [conservative](https://www.youtube.com/user/PragerUniversity) youtube channels to keep my mind open. Unfortunately, thanks to my views not being in line within the dichotomy, none of the current major presidential candidates, republican or democrat, are completely in line with my views. I want to vote for a third party, but it would just be a protest vote every time I do.

The two parties directly oppose each other ideologically, but will fight tooth and nail at the prospect of a newcomer. A major third party and threatening them? How dare they, the two-party system is the only way they keep at least 40% of the vote every single election no matter what. They don't want added complexity, which is why [in the last election, a candidate needed at least 15% of the vote in polls to participate in a debate, which universally shut out everyone except Obama and Romney.](http://www.debates.org/index.php?page=candidate-selection-process).

There will be a few third party candidates who will gain upsets and get elected, but it will never be enough to change the system thanks to our First Past the Post voting system, gerrymandered districts, and just the fact that the two main parties are far more resourced than all of the others.

966,CMV: the grade point average system is better than the British honours degree classification system.,TRUE,1,t3_3au4gn,"My basic reasoning behind thinking that GPA is better than the [British honours degree classification system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_undergraduate_degree_classification)(the 1st, 2:1, 2:2, 3rd degrees you get in the UK) is that GPA is simply a more accurate representation of academic achievement. GPA allows for a more refined estimate of a student's achievement, since there are more possible combinations you can get with GPA(3.9, 3.91, 3.99, etc.). Whereas with the British honours degree classification, you can only get the 4 that I've previously mentioned(or a fail). That seems unfair if for example you're on the edge of getting 2:1 but just miss the mark and get a 2:2. Lastly, I'll mention that British universities [seem to recognise](https://www.heacademy.ac.uk/workstreams-research/themes/assessment-and-feedback/grade-point-average-gpa/gpa-faqs) this and there are a few that are experimenting with using GPA.

674,"CMV: The predictions made in The Torah, their unlikeliness and the fact that they came true, make a strong case for the truth of the Torah",FALSE,0,t3_3df23x,"Note: I do not believe that these prove anything conclusively, either the truth of the torah nor the existence of god, just that these predictions make a very strong case. 

Deuteronomy 28 consists, basically, of a long series of predictions for the fate of the jews. Among these are that the temple will be destroyed, the jews will be scattered across the globe, they will be persecuted and remain small in number,  and that they will eventually return to the land of israel. 

Im currently on mobile with a very poor connection and can not find all of the relevant quotes but here are some:

""The Lord will bring a nation against you from afar, from the end of the earth, as swift as the eagle flies, a nation whose language you will not understand, a nation of fierce countenance, which does not respect the elderly nor show favour to the young.""

When the jews were conquered and the temple was destroyed, it was done so by the romans who spoke latin. The jews at this time would not have understood latin.  However, had nearly any other large or close nation been the ones to attack the jews, it is very likely that they would have known the language. Many of the closer nations, the jews traded with or dealt with politically and thus would have known their language.  Because of this, predicting that their conquerors would speak an unknown language is not a likely prediction and it is strange that it comes true. 

""AND THE L-RD SHALL SCATTER THEE AMONG ALL PEOPLE, FROM THE ONE END OF THE EARTH EVEN UNTO THE OTHER; AND THERETHOU SHALT SERVE OTHER G-DS,""

When the jews were conquered, they were scattered across the lands. This is strange both as a prediction and as an event. After conquering a nation, it was rare, if it happened at all, for the nation to be dispersed in this manner. Usually the conquerors would either use their victims as slaves, or keep them around to collect taxes. To disperse a nation like this makes no sense because then the conquerors have much less to gain. 

""You who were as numerous as the stars in the sky will be left but few in number, because you did not obey the Lord your God.""

The prediction here is that the jewish population will remain small. This has also come true. The current jewish population is around 14.2 millions people, or only .2% of the world. While few in number is not specific, remaining less than a percent of the world seems to be fairly small. 

""Among those nations you will find no repose, no resting place for the sole of your foot. There the Lord will give you an anxious mind, eyes weary with longing, and a despairing heart. 66 You will live in constant suspense, filled with dread both night and day, never sure of your life.""

This verse seems to indicate the ever presence of anti-semitism.  Despite being so small in numbers, jews have faced persecution at nearly every place they have gone. This prediction seems more obvious, as many strangers seem to face discrimination, but a prediction that came true regardless. 

Edit:  I don't have any more time to post tonight, but I will be able to read anything posted tomorrow. I awarded one delta for proof that the jews would have very likely spoken latin at that time. Any further direct contradictions to any of the prophecies, as well as any other prophecies in this section of the torah that don't come true would be greatly appreciated. Additionally, examples of predictions from other major religions that came true in similar matters would help. Thanks CMV!

""The Lord your God will return your captivity and have mercy upon you and he will gather you in from all the nations to He had scattered you. Even if you will be dispersed to the end of the Heavens – from there your God will gather you…God will gather you and bring you back to the land that your forefathers possessed and you shall posses it.”

This is actually from chapter 30, but is still relevant. To have predicted 3000 years ago that the jews would not only be kicked out of israel, but would eventually come back to own it is remarkable. It could be argued that this is a self-fulfilling prophecy, Israel was only given to the jews because of this prediction, but even if that is the case it is still incredible to have predicted 3000 years ago that not only would the jews still be around but that they would be able to reclaim ownership of israel. 

It is my belief that these predictions make a strong case for the truth of the torah. Not only did they come true, but they are predictions that did not make sense to make at the time, and would have seemed at the time to be very unlikely. The fact that they came true is at the very least a remarkable coincidence, and creates very strong evidence for the torah to be taken as truth. ",674,FALSE,,FALSE,0
87,CMV: Hitler was a terrible leader.,FALSE,0,t3_3ib7im,"Often when Hitler or Nazi Germany is brought up on reddit you'll see a comment along the lines of 'Sure Hitler was evil, but you gotta admit he was a good leader' or something along those lines with the idea being that Hitler was a pretty sharp leader who pulled Germany out of a depression and made it great again. I disagree, Hitler was a godawful leader, as good leaders tend not to leave their countries into such total destruction. And the claim that Hitler saved Germany from depression is false, the economic reforms that pulled Germany's bacon out of the economic fire were done by [Hjalmar Schacht.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hjalmar_Schacht) Hitler's economic policies set Germany on the course to [financial ruin](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3i78h9/why_do_some_historians_say_nazi_germany_was/cudz604) and forced them into a situation where the only way to survive was to invade and plunder their neighbors. 


So. Hitler ruined the previously successful economic situation, made military alliances with Italy and Japan that did nothing for him except get him in further trouble with an American enemy and an Italian ally constantly needing help, played hell with the warfront by sacking any general who crossed his opinion, and spent valuable resources creating internal strife by persecuting his own people.



So I say Hitler was a good speaker, but a terrible leader.

CMV Reddit, you can do it.

435,CMV: Women are inferior to men in most aspects of life.,TRUE,1,t3_3fa3pf,"I understand that this is a very controversial thing to say.  Perhaps my view comes from the women I am surrounded by, which is quite a small sample size. I look forward to hearing another point of view.

My main points:

1.) Physically.  Men dominate sports and physical events.  I can't think of one sport that women are better than men at, in general, and if there are a few, that's only a few, and men dominate the rest. 

2.) In the work place.  This is the most controversial part.  Women want equal pay, but from what I've seen in my limited 8 years in industry, is that women are not as good as men at their jobs.  My industry is oil refining.  99% of the plant workers are men, why?  I work in the Engineering office.  There are no women engineers, only secretaries, and some of them baffle me at how incompetent they are. (Admittedly our one secretary is excellent at her job, and does far better than I ever could.  But my point here is that a man could do that job just as well.) 

3.) At home.  This is where most of my point lies.  It could just be a gender roles thing, but why am I so much better at everything than my girlfriend?  I'm not saying I'm great, but rather most of the girlfriends I've had are completely incompetent at a lot of things.  Things like building an Ikea cabinet, she can't do it.  Small, mundane challenges like un-stacking and re-stacking a sleeve of solo cups.  We had to do it as part of a challenge, and I was much faster at it.  She couldn't figure out how the gear shifters worked on a newer mountain bike after riding it for 10 minutes.  I had never seen this type before, but figured it out in 10 seconds.  Not because I'm clever, but because it is simple and something I believe should be easy for any adult to figure out. 

These reasons are why I hold this view.  I look forward to being completely flamed for this view, and also for another perspective.  Thanks.

1486,"CMV: I don't believe requiring able-bodied, mentally capable adults who receive welfare to work is a form of slave labor",FALSE,0,t3_35rqpn,"I consider myself very left wing but I've found that the Democratic and Socialist parties consider workfare a form of slave labor. I don't see how this is the case - we are all working for money and benefits, unfortunately there is no ""free lunch"" for any of us. If people who are capable of working are receiving free benefits, what is wrong with requiring them to work? 

Maybe I am missing something with regard to single or stay at home parents, or perhaps workfare does not give people enough time to go find the job they want. I would like to add that I see a difference between letting private companies profit off cheap labor, and having the welfare recipients work on government projects. Is workfare always to the benefit of private companies?

 Please, CMV!

1439,"CMV:The outrage, emotional investment, and hate the general population has in relation to the Tsarnaev case is blown way out of proportion, particularly in Boston",FALSE,0,t3_363jk5,"Some Context: Frist off I grew up around the Boston area, graduated from a college in Boston, currently work and live in Boston, was on the marathon route (about 2 miles away) when the bombing occurred, I always have and always will consider Boston home.

Secondly, I am not asking people to explain why they feel he they believe he should receive the death penalty or not. Or even why his crimes are worthy of the death penalty. His actions are reprehensible, and I fully believe he is guilty and should receive punishment in accordance with law befitting his crimes.

Anyways,

The bombing and subsequent manhunt resulted in 4 deaths and a dozens of injuries. Clearly a terrible tragedy, please do not misconstrue me, I think that what happened was awful.

However, I think the response, especially around Boston has been extremely disproportionate.
News articles, to blogs, to overheard conversations, to David Ortiz, for the past 2 years all you hear is a sensationalized response that includes hate speech, violent calls for vengeance, overly emotional opining, and nonsense about ""Boston strong"" that arises from mob mentality I have seen countless comments on articles saying incredibly vengeful and disturbing things wished on Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, ""I want to see him hang in the streets"" is a very mild example. Additionally I have seen a lot of anti-Muslim rhetoric and straight out bigotry because of these events.
BostonStrong has become synonymous with the city and its prominent organizations. A charity for the victims (some of which include very profitable retail business in Copley Square) of the bombing has gathered millions in donations. I have seen people even tangentially related to Boston claiming it was an emotional and devastating event for them, again not victims, but someone who might have lived in Boston a few years back. What does Boston Strong even mean? I personally believe it means nothing. Boston reacted the way any city would to two rogue terrorists. It started as a way to raise money for the one fund but has devolved into nothing more than a marketing gimmick for area businesses and something for bros to use as a hashtag.

However when you look at the outrage, vitriol, and media coverage surrounding other violent crimes, for example serial rape, multiple homicides, pedophilia, even drunk driving homicides. The level of interest and reaction is not even close.

I understand it was a very public event with terrorist intentions, but people in Boston act like it's the next 9/11. It simply is not. No where near the damage and no connection to an international terrorist organization.

In many ways I think the actions of drunk drivers who kill a car full of innocents are as much or more reprehensible than those of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. A drunk driver kills someone due to their own selfishness and stupidity. Dzhokhar and his brother believed they were getting justice for innocent people killed in Afghanistan and Iraq. He knew very well that he would likely be caught, and yet he believed strongly enough that what he was doing was right that he went through with it then penned a letter in blood stating his motive as he lay dying in a boat.

I'm not defending his actions I think they are terrible but I think the outrage and rah-rah mob mentality and blind patriotism (city-ism?) I've seen for the past two years is grossly misplaced. The Boston Strong mentality is flawed, the Tsarnaevs didn't attack Boston they attacked the US, Boston just happened to be where they lived, and while it was great to see a city come together after a tragedy I believe the Boston Strong thing was taken too far. Around college campuses it became a rallying cry to legitimize bigotry about immigrants from the middle east and an excuse to party, meanwhile atrocities committed by born and bred Americans go largely unnoticed.

While no one I know personally was injured by the events, I am still from Boston but I failed to be personally hurt or particularly jarred by these events. Meanwhile, I witnessed students who had been in the city for a handful of months post impassioned social media posts calling for executions and making claims to how strong and resilient ""their city was"", no one was gonna mess with ""their"" town that they had been inhabiting for a whopping 1.5 college semesters.

I think his crimes were terrible, but no more terrible than other similar crimes, and certainly not warranting the reaction that has occurred since Marathon Monday 2013. I just can't get behind the lynch mob, or the notion that somehow Boston reacted better than any other city would.

TLDR- The hate, vitriol, and mob mentality surrounding the Dzhokhar Tsarnaev case is blown way out of proportion, considering atrocities that occur every day. this is particularly bad in Boston and even worse in Boston student communities.

1094,"CMV: Climate change should be every politician's first priority, and we are doing too little about it, since no one seems to care anymore",TRUE,1,t3_39ph4q,"Climate change has been a problem for decades and we have done very little about it. The Kyoto Protocol had obviously failed, and had since become forgotten. I'm not an expert on climate but statistics do serve as solid evidence for this issue, and it had been viewed as one of the fastest growing problems of the century.

I understand preventing climate change is not as feasible as it looks, regarding economic, environmental and societal factors; not to mention the controversial opinions and theories surrounding it. But the key is that the majority of scientists agree on the same consensus that it is indeed a human caused issue, and all promote the cliched ""decrease greenhouse gas emissions"" solution. But obviously its place in the media has become less prominent while it should be a considered growing problem whose severity should be taken seriously.

680,CMV: The greeks are acting like entitled children.,TRUE,1,t3_3de3uy,"Hi, I'm new.

So the greeks are complaining about the EU's imposed austerity measures, the terms of their countries increasing debt problems, even going as far as to boycott german goods and compare them to nazi's.

But they *have* been outspending their means, and are lashing out because they have gotten used to their improved quality of life under the euro and are now being threatened with having that QOL decreased.

The alternative to the imposed austerity measures is the country defaulting on its debts and becoming a failed state, and the rest of the EU is taking on a large risk by continuing to loan to a country which over the last 5 years has done nothing but ignore the demands of their creditors and complain about sanctions.

Yes, its the government's fault and not the people's, but they can't reasonably refuse cuts to their public spending that they can no longer afford, and moreover, why blame the eurozone for trying to help, and not their own incompetent government? Edit: And striking, as if their country didn't have enough problems already?!

827,CMV: Parents are not entitled to unconditional respect from their children just by virtue of being their parents.,TRUE,1,t3_3c4ur8,"First off, I am not a parent. Maybe that disqualifies me from making any comments about this matter in the first place. Either way, I am a fairly objective person and I can admit when I am wrong.

I do not buy into the whole argument of 'just because our parents brought us into the world, we owe them our lives.' Whether a child was brought into the world by choice or not, I don't think that being born should impose a debt of respect on the child. 

Furthermore, I think that this respect needs to be earned. I define respect in this context as 'regard for another person's rational ability, trusting that they can admit when they are wrong and that their decisions are well-thought-out.'

This is why I think that giving the reason 'because I said so' is a total cop out. If the parent is not open to having a conversation about the reason for their actions, then I don't think they deserve the child's respect. 

Don't get me wrong, I think it is crucial for a child to be told when they are wrong so that they don't grow up into narcissistic asshats. However, I think that they deserve a logical conversation with a parent until one side admits, of his own accord, that he is in the wrong.

443,"CMV: If you or I were in charge of the entire nuclear arsenal of the United States and were to find out that another country had launched multiple warheads at the U.S., the correct response would be to not launch our own nukes and instead let them hit us and only us.",TRUE,1,t3_3f7ji6,"So I was arguing with a friend of mine about this recently and here is my main reasoning behind this view.

1: Assuming they have already launched their entire arsenal at us there most likely nothing we could do to stop the missiles from destroying us. This essentially means we have lost at this point and there's nothing we can do about it. To launch the nukes at that point becomes an act of revenge accomplishes absolutely nothing for anyone. 

2: To launch these nukes hurts innocent people in whatever country attacked us who likely had no choice in the launches and causes us to sink down to the level that the agressing country sits at.

3: Returning fire almost certainly bears the promise of environmental collapse and in doing so dooms everyone on the planet as well as billions of species of plants and animals. If we don't launch and instead let ourselves be hit we still have the possibility of saving the world entire.

If i remember any of my other points I will edit them into the main post.

1456,CMV: One of the best ways to help against Inequality would be to give men paid maternity leave aswell,TRUE,1,t3_360oqp,"Whether employers admit it or not, one of the biggest hurdles for women wanting to get in jobs is the possibility that they may at one point get pregnant and have to leave work for an extended period of time, meaning the manager has to find a way to make up for the work the woman may have done, and have to pay them while they are away. This leads many people to have at least a small bias is the idea that hiring a man will be more permanent and a higher chance of more potential profit in the long run.

However, if the man who conceived the baby also got maternity leave, this would mean the risk is equal no matter what gender you hire. During maternity leave, the man would take care of the child with the woman, allowing for both of them to take care of the child, and allow the child to get more recognition of the father. 

This may also help stopping the idea that a women is necessarily the one who has to take care of the child, another stereotype that is often regarded as bad.

This could also theoretically help with rare events such as when male homosexual couples get a women (who would not raise the child) to birth the child for them given that they can’t.

This would ofcourse not solve all the problems with inequality in the genders, but I think this might be a good way to help (although since I’m posting it here, obviously I’m not /sure/ it’s a good idea)

1285,CMV: Our local bridge's rails should not be heightened to prevent suicide off the bridge into the water,TRUE,1,t3_37okwz,"I think it's a dystopic society that would want to prevent people from leaving this world. If someone wants to go, they should be able to. If there is any meaning in calling life ""free"" then one should freely be able to leave at their discretion.

Raising the rails could be argued for as a preventative measure for someone throwing someone else off the bridge, but that's not what I'm interested in. Should it be raised as a preventative for suicide.

I don't think suicide is as much of a problem as we think. ""People shouldn't commit suicide"" - this belief stems from Middle Age christian era and seems to have been passed on from generation to generation. I don't have any scientific knowledge, in fact I don't think there can even be any scientific knowledge that can imply a reasoning such as this. It seems to me to be an idea that could be true and also may not be true.

Further, who am I to judge that someone else's life with someone else's perspective that it is always wrong to kill oneself? Surely even with a simple cost-benefit analysis it can sometimes be ok.

I still understand the sadness that arises when someone does it, but it's not because they've done it, it's because of where they must've been to want to do it.

Sure, I'll admit that raising them may prevent a few cases, but someone that is intent on doing will still climb over it. But I don't know for sure that it will, there's no evidence to my knowledge that supports this. Then there's also the side that raising the bars will make the initial altitude higher and increase the acceleration of the falling person increasing the likelihood of death from the impact.

For those who don't want to change my mind, I'm interested in hearing your arguments that support my opinion also.

Thanks!

120,CMV: I should avoid relationships my whole life.,FALSE,0,t3_3i1b69,"I am 23 and have only had one actual girlfriend before, but I had 5 or 6 sexual partners in college, off the top of my head. I don't consider myself socially awkward in the least, but I am often quiet and have had a couple girls I know tell me I am ""aloof"" and ""reserved."" Several girls I've been with have told me that I could get any girl I want based on my looks and intelligence, but instead of making me cocky, it hasn't done anything to improve my lack of confidence. I have a quick temper, but I'm good at controlling it. During the work week, I don't socialize much just because I don't have much time to. When I socialize on the weekends, I usually ""bro-out"" and go grab a few drinks with a couple of my buddies, although I do often get invited to large gatherings/parties and my friends almost always let me know if there's a big gathering happening. So basically, I'm not meeting girls on a frequent basis and I'm not really sure how to do it doesn't include drinking in some way or another. Sometimes I try to imagine what life would be like if I never get into another relationship to prepare myself for that possibility. I did well with the college hookup scene, but am clueless when it comes to post-grad socializing...

There are very slim pickings at my work for potential dates (by that, I mean there is only girl I would consider dating, and she is basically one of the guys) and I don't believe I'm going to find the love of my life in one of the dive bars near my house, so I am not meeting a lot of girls that interest me with my current lifestyle.

This front page doesn't have to house hate speech or hostile ideologies. I think removing these will only make reddit a more positive and progressive place to be. 

I think free speech can flourish without hate speech. I think we can recognize accurately the INTENTION of certain subreddits. Some can be gross, negative or downright morbid but don't have ill intentions but I think its the intention that matters and I feel from the [announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3dautm/content_policy_update_ama_thursday_july_16th_1pm/) that those subreddits with vile intetions will be removed while other ""alternative"" subreddits will be just fine.

I think certain viruses have an intention to spread through the body and I think some subreddits here can be likened to viruses so I can only see a positive outcome when extracting these viruses out of the community.

779,CMV: The tax on rich people is way too high and is therefore unfair.,FALSE,0,t3_3ch2dc,"People always talk about how rich people (i.e. mega-millionaires and billionaires) are not paying their ""fair share"" in terms of income taxes. They say how the tax rate for the rich should not be smaller than the tax rate for those who are not rich. But even if there is a great disparity in tax RATES, the AMOUNT of taxes that a mega-millionaire or billionaire has to pay is still greater than the average person's. For example, an income tax rate of 10% on a person making 10 million dollars a year means that that person would have to pay 1 million dollars in taxes, but an income tax rate of 30% on a person making 100,000 dollars a year means that that person would have to pay 30,000 dollars*. Even though the millionaire has a lower tax rate, it's not fair that he/she has to pay 1 million dollars in taxes while another person only has to pay 30,000 dollars. There shouldn't be a penalty in the form of tax for people who make a lot of money; it's simply not fair.

83,"CMV: A refrigerator should be a required condition of habitability, not just an amenity.",FALSE,0,t3_3idxla,"Just moved to California starting look for an apartment. much to my dismay 9/10 apartments I viewed do not include refrigerators in the lease. I'm from Detroit - where every single apartment I viewed had a fridge included. The first apartment I went to I was like - WHAT? NO FRIDGE????


[In California, a refrigerator is not a habitable condition. It's an amenity.] (http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jan/08/business/la-fi-rent-20120108)
I found out via r/personalfinance that in Texas  - an air conditioning unit is a habitable condition - meaning the landlord must provide and repair it. In fact, when your A/C unit breaks (and its not tenants' fault), you might not owe rent for days its broken because the unit is only livable while the A/C is working per Texas law.  


There are several reasons state law should change to make a fridge a habitable condition. 

*  *I believe every other state requires this as a habitable condition, correct me if I'm wrong.* In my personal opinion an apartment without a fridge in not habitable, wouldn't you agree? but more importantly.... 

* *There's a lot of illegal bait-and-switch going on in the apartment rental market.* I'm shopping for an apartment now and I would say about half the listings that say ""fridge included"" are just outright lies. I caught a landlord in this lie just yesterday. He said ""oh well I must have made a mistake online..."" This also happens with dishwashers and with rent prices. You're not fooling any damn body, you listed imaginary apartment with fake pictures, just to get people to show up so you can start throwing sales shit at them.  Sometimes, in areas where the market is really hot (such as West Hollywood), people sign for apartments without having seen the inside first (because the unit is already leased by the time previous tenants move out). Making a fridge an optional amenity gives landlords the ability to LIE and say the unit comes with a fridge and then when they move in, they find out that the fridge belonged to the previous tenants. 
You might say ""well they should read the lease before they sign"" but that logic only holds up in theory. In reality you know there are people getting screwed over on this issue. Such as people from other states who it never occurred to them that a fridge might not be included. 

* *California law should mimc Texas law* When a habitable condition appliance breaks, the landlord is losing rent money every day it sits broken. In Michigan, when a unit is unlivable, a tenant can break a lease with no penalty and no notice. That gives them very strong incentive to hurry up and fix it already. 
If Texas does this with air conditioners, why cant California do this with a damn refrigerator?

I can't stand watching a scene when someone is suffering for ""free"", but so far in my life I felt like the only one feeling disturbed in those moment; so far, everyone I know has no problem watching. But I keep thinking I am the normal one and people should not enjoy (it sounds weird but I am not forbidding people to do anything. People should not enjoy drinking bleach. But if you want to drink a full bottle I have no problem with that). 

On the front page right now, there is a r/WTF link with 4k upvote (or score): 3972 Man Still Alive After being Cut in half by train [NSFL].
I think you would have to pay me something like 1k$ to have me click on this link. But 4k people clicking on it **and recommending it to others**, I don't understand. Whatever gore picture is behind this, is it fun ? What is the motivation, the enjoyment ?

I guess I should be a bit more clear, why would people choose to feel fear (like in horror movie, from which windows is the killer going to come from ?) or feel sick (let's see some dead body in a bad condition but with blood everywhere) when they could avoid that ? Isn't that madness/psychopath demeanor ?

186,CMV: Faith based organizations (i.e. religious groups) should not be allowed to discriminate against people on the basis of their beliefs.,TRUE,1,t3_3hel6u,"(Inspired by [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/3hcpw9/point_79_of_the_conservative_party_policy_allows/) post.) My position is that faith based organizations (i.e. religious groups) should not be given any special protection and should follow the same laws as every other organization with respect to discrimination against protected classes.  

For the purposes of this discussion, I am using the ""[Canadian Human Rights Act](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/h-6/)"" as the thing that defines discrimination. The protected classes from this act are:

1. race
2. national or ethnic origin
3. colour
4. religion
5. age
6. sex
7. sexual orientation
8. marital status
9. family status
10. disability
11. conviction for an offence for which a pardon has been granted

My position is that the right to have freedom of religion does not superseed these rights. If your religion is not able to be tolerant with respect to these rights, then your religion has no place in our tolerant society. These quotations also aptly describe my position:

“Tolerance of intolerance is cowardice.” 
― Ayaan Hirsi Ali

“Don't get so tolerant that you tolerate intolerance.” 
―  Bill Maher

-------------

Some possible criticisms to this position and my response below:

--------------------

Q: But this means that churches would be forced to do Jewish ceremonies!

A: This is not the case. Section 5 of the Human Rights Act states that discrimination occurs when someone is denied a ""provision of goods, services, facilities or accommodation customarily available to the general public"" based on the above protected classes. It is only discrimination if the service is generally available but specifically denied to a protected class.

---------------------------

Q: But this means that churches would be forced to hire atheists as priests!

A:  Section 15.1.a of the Human Rights Act already allows for an exemption for positions established by an employer to be based on a bona fide occupational requirement, which I think would qualify here.

-----------------------------

Q: But this means a bunch of bozos can come in and make a mockery of my church!

A: Being respectful is not a protected class. If someone is not being respectful of your church, it is not discrimination to ask them to leave. 

------------------------------

Q: But this means that churches would be forced to perform same sex marriages!

A: Yes, and my position is that if a religious group is not tolerant with respect to sexual orientation, then this religion has no place in our society. I realize that this facet in particular is the most controversial part of my position.

-----------

EDIT: Ok, I have been reminded that in addition to the Human Rights Act, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms establishes freedom of religion. Since it would be impossible to satisfy both freedom of every religion and also my position above, some balancing is necessary. Thus I think any violations of the Human Rights Act would have to be weighed on a case by case basis against the right to their religion. This explains a lot of opposing views on this issue for me: it seems that other people lean more toward the freedom of religion side, whereas I lean more toward the Human Rights side.

876,CMV: Wanting to be a different gender is no different than wanting to be a different race or age,FALSE,0,t3_3bnw4c,"If I was to say that I always relate more to women, and in my heart feel that I should have been born a woman, how is that any different than saying that I feel like a Mexican stuck in a white man's body?  Or a 65 year old stuck in a 32 year old's body?

If I started wearing a poncho and sombrero and asking people to call me Pedro, I'd be laughed at and ignored (or beat up).  If told people that I feel 65 (or even went as far as having surgery to make me look 65), AARP still wouldn't accept me. It wouldn't matter if, deep in my heart, I truly wanted to be a 65 year-old Mexican. Why would my desire to be a woman be respected?

I don't mean to come across offensive or callous, and I have no problem with people dressing as another gender (or even having surgery to make them more closely resemble another gender).  I just don't think that the government should classify somebody based on their desires, but rather on the presence or absence of a Y chromosome.

372,"CMV: Humans are actually a very primitive species. Crimes like murder and rape are to be expected, are not inherently immoral, and we overreact to them because they break order in society.",FALSE,0,t3_3ftff4,"Okay, this is a tough, long one to write out and explain, but I'll do my best. Currently I am actually having trouble understanding why these crimes are inherently wrong, other than that if they were not thought of as terrible, all hell would break loose and there would be no order. I am honestly open to changing my view (I even desire to change it, as I think I'm becoming extremely cynical). For some background I am in a graduate program in neuroscience. 

Moving on...I am sure someone might say ""well how would you like it if you/your family were raped/murdered"", but I feel that kind of reinforces my point - this reason just shows we are afraid of backlash, and thus order in society is necessary. 

---&gt; First of all, despite what we pretend to be, I honestly believe humans are actually very primitive. This means they are violent, still think with their ""reptilian brains"", and except outliers, are trying to fulfill their evolutionary/biological purpose - to create offspring.  Examples of what I see as proof for the primitive claim: 

a) Perhaps some will point to the vast increases in science in technology as evidence that we are in fact not primitive, but 99.9999% of those increases come from 0.00001% of the population. Does the average human (on a global scale) really have anything to do with sending a man up to the moon or discovering a cure for a disease?

b) Incredible amount of violence. The Holocaust was not too long ago...hundreds of thousands of soldiers/civilian supporters/etc all advocating for and carrying out genocide that killed millions. And that is just one example (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_genocides_by_death_toll). I don't believe that a handful of ""evil"" people could have carried these out - instead they were carried out by a group, albeit smaller, like 10% or so, and supported by something like 40%, and shown indifference by the majority of the rest. Again, need I mention ISIS, American acts against Natives, African tribe warfare, the list goes on. I believe every single human (yes you behind the computer screen) is capable of shocking violence or brutality. Our capacity and frequency of violence shows we are primitive.

c) Factors in sexual attraction. This is a big one, because almost every single human is ""guilty"" of it. Both men and women will say they are looking for someone who is ""kind, intelligent, etc"", but much research has shown the most attractive trait women look for is height. The biggest reason for this is evolution - a bigger hunter/gatherer, protector, even dominator of women. Do women in cushy Western society today really need a big guy to protect them...I don't think so. For men, it is a combination of fertility signs (e.g. hip ratio) and youth. Again, personality goes out the window when you are looking at a woman with a beautiful figure. If you think about it, the sexual preferences of a human today (height, strength, resources for women...or beauty, fertility for men) are honestly closer to the sexual preferences of our closest relative, the chimpanzee, than to some mythical advanced human civilization that places the utmost value on compassion, intelligence, etc. Again, to me this shows that we are quite primitive.

d) There is a similar primitive basis in other human ideas, like blind patriotism, or even racism in all aspects of society, from dating to careers (similar to animosity between tribes of chimpanzees, and attempts to maintain social hierarchy within tribes). Another one is harmful religious beliefs and traditions held by majority of humanity (showing a lack of understanding for science, progress). Not to bring another argument into this debate, but a good example is circumcision - 60% of male babies in the USA will be circumcised (99% for non-medical reasons), and 100-200 will die from complications, although thankfully there are a few societies, like Germany, where this is illegal, it still shows you how primitive we really are. Same thing (worse health effects for most types) on the other side of the planet with FGM. 

----&gt; Thus, I think we've fooled ourselves into thinking we have become so advanced (morally, scientifically) as a species and civilization. In fact, we are extremely primitive, and I think the outrage and shock that we feel when we hear of a rape or murder victim (or any other serious crime) is honestly just a farce. Of course I don't mean to say that people who feel sad and angry are lying, but I mean that our empathy here stems from societal teachings. 

Given what we are capable of, given our track record in history, is it really so surprising if a man rapes a woman? After all, if we are this primitive, we are all just trying to spread our genes, create offspring, survive, reproduce, and so on.

Example - I might say: Isn't it wrong that a compassionate, intelligent person will not reproduce if he/she does not meet the primitive biological preferences of humans today? Well, you would say: It might be wrong, but it's just because of the sexual preferences (read: primitive nature) of humanity. In the same way, you might say: Isn't it terribly wrong if a person rapes another, steals all their money, kills their enemies and competition? I might say: It might be wrong, but it's just because of the primitive nature of humanity. 

---

**In summary: humans are actually very primitive, as is evident by their violence, sexual preferences, racism, and harmful religious practices. Murder, rape, theft is to be expected in such a primitive species. We overreact to these crimes because it disrupts the order of society, not because they are inherently immoral.**

Anyway, please CMV! By the way, I talked about murder/rape because it is easy to feel empathy for the victims, but this extends to all other crimes. Also, no religious arguments please.

614,"CMV: Free markets are great, but they are inappropriate for necessities like housing, etc.",FALSE,0,t3_3e0cjp,"I think free markets are an excellent idea and am generally one of your small-government, financially conservative types. I feel that the whole idea of free markets necessarily includes both parties being able to ""walk away from the deal"". Fundamentally that can't be the case when you're talking about necessities, such as housing, health care, education, utilities, transportation, and heck, even internet. The whole USA is going through an embarrassing struggle with healthcare. Parts of the country such as San Francisco are having crises with housing availability and sky-rocketing rent. The cost of college has increased staggeringly in our lifetime. Internet providers are lobbying congress with some success to discourage or even outlaw competition.

No one benefits from a neighbor struggling to have the basics. It is simply in all of our best interests to have everybody confident that they can work and live and get treatment if they're sick.

I have avoided talking about how to institute this change, since it's not my field. I am admittedly not a political scientist or economist of any kind (I'm a cook), which is why I'm so interested to see what new things you guys can show me. Thanks!

**Edit: consider me royally convinced! I understand that the problem is much more conplicated, different markets have unique challenges, and most USA markets are not ""free markets"" in very important ways. I'm still strongly in favor of socialized medicine, but I can see that similar solutions for housing and other necessities are very problematic, and potentially worse than a free market solution.**

703,CMV: Anger is largely an unhealthy investment of time and energy,FALSE,0,t3_3d6shb,"There are very few instances I can think of in which anger is helpful or positive. I spend a fair amount of time on reddit reading people get angry about a whole range of things which are ultimately fruitless or destructive, including:

- The annoying or illogical things other people do

- The unjust way people are treated, from big corporations to the unjust ways governments and groups treat others

- Unfair events or circumstances, including unfair treatment of members of their own class

And many many more. My point is that responding to these events with anger - and not just with the feeling but the EXPRESSION of that anger - ultimately only makes the speaker and listeners feel more enraged, while doing nothing to learn more about the situation or make it better. 

Anger is a completely normal human emotion, and I'm not proposing that we become emotionless robots or not express our frustration. But generally speaking, the more anger we express, ultimately the less productive the conversation will be. 

Put another way - in a relationship, there is almost NO value in having anger toward your partner because it stifles communication and prevents each partner from trying to understand more about each other's actions. 

We are all humans, nearly all trying our best to find happiness, and anger robs us of our ability to see that in others.

133,CMV:I believe European countries should only take in female refugees,FALSE,0,t3_3humc2,"This post is about Europe because that is the only context I am familiar enough to argue about. Feel free to bring up other contexts, though. 

I believe Europe should only take in female refugees due to three reasons. Women and girls are harmed far worse in the conflicts and in the refugee camps than men and boys are. The receiving countries suffer from the violence and criminality of those refugees who fail to integrate, and lastly having clear lines on who can enter and can not does not create false hope and unnecessary deaths. At the moment refugees are over 70% male, which in practice means we mostly ignore the most vulnerable population.

Women are the primary victims of these conflicts:
&gt;In many societies, women and girls face specific risks and are less likely than men and boys to have access to their rights, due to their gender roles and position in society. In situations of displacement, these risks – particularly discrimination and sexual and gender-based violence – can be exacerbated.

Some reports have found that 95% of refugee women have been raped:

Crime. Higher criminality of men is well known.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_crime

As is that of immigrants and refugees from poor countries.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_crime

Recently Sweden Democrats, an anti-immigrant party polled as the largest party in Sweden, after an asylum seeker murdered two people in Ikea for no apparent reason. The debate about refugee criminality seems to be leading many to rather extreme positions. Since women commit next to no sex and violent crime, especially in patriarchal cultures, this would relieve some of the fears of the native populations.

The last argument is admittedly weak. People are very bad at probabilities. Therefore it might be best not to take in men at all, as that would create false hope and cause many of them to risk their lives and property in hopes of an asylum. From a cost perspective, it would be easier and faster to automatically deport all men. Some family exceptions would of course be appropriate.

They won't go around posting my information publically, as I'm sure the privacy policy forbids that (and what would they gain from that anyway? I'm just a number to them, among billions of others). Hell, I'm even glad my information is being used to personalise the ads that get shown to me, for instance; If I'm putting up with ads, I'd rather have products that actually pertain to my interests advertised to me than things I find irrelevant.

983,CMV: I believe that universities should have an affirmative action program dedicated to increasing the number of students and faculty who hold conservative political views,TRUE,1,t3_3anzqm,"One of the major policy appeals behind affirmative action is the creation of a diverse environment. A completely homogeneous environment is unlikely to be as intellectually fulfilling as a diverse one. Universities have done an excellent job in creating an environment that has tons of racial, sexual, ethnic and religious diversity. However, it still lacks intellectual and political diversity. People with conservative or right-wing views are [woefully unrepresented](http://www.criticalreview.com/crf/pdfs/klein_stern.pdf) in academia, particularly in the social sciences. Not only does this make people with conservative political views feel unwelcome and unappreciated in the university environment, it threatens the perceived validity of the research done. [This is even recognized by some leftists themselves](https://inequalitiesblog.wordpress.com/2011/02/07/right-wing-study-of-inequality/). How are you supposed to have valid research, let alone critical thinking, when there is an absolute hegemony of leftist views, which no one dares challenge due to their overwhelmingly disproportionate power and influence on campus? Therefore, to make university a more diverse environment and encourage critical thinking, we should prioritize student and faculty applicants who are affiliated with right wing organizations, and ensure that peer review panels have at least one right wing professor on them CMV.

1098,CMV: The current anti-abortion movement is more about punishing sexually active women than saving the unborn,FALSE,0,t3_39nxe8,"I can understand and respect the point of view of those who hold a sincere belief that life begins at conception and that an embryo or fetus should be treated as a life that should be protected.  However, I think that much of the current anti-abortion stance is more about punishing sexually active women than about protecting unborn children.  I believe this because many or most of the people who are against abortion simultaneously hold the point of view that access to birth control and aid to poor families should be reduced or eliminated, and maternity leave (or lack thereof) should be left up to employers.   Birth control prevents pregnancy, and free or reduced birth control goes a long ways to prevent unwanted pregnancy and subsequent abortions.  Paid maternity leave helps new mothers and their babies bond, heal and generally get a good start.  Aid to poor families provides a basic safety net to keep young families from going hungry or homeless.  The knowledge of a basic safety net would encourage those who become pregnant unintentionally from aborting due to financial pressure.

I find it disingenuous that many of those who claim to be in favor of protecting the unborn are against the very policies that make life easier for young families.  I think by simultaneously holding the views against abortion, birth control, paid maternity leave, and aid to families one is displaying that they care more about punishing sexually active women, and by extension their children, by creating a situation that virtually ensures a live of struggle for those women who do not have a supportive partner.

I am not sure what would change my mind, but I am a reasonable and logical person.  If it can be demonstrated to me how individuals who simultaneously hold the views that I described can truly interested in the well-being of the unplanned fetus and the person it will eventually and the family unit in general become I am open to changing my mind.

------------
Edit: I have changed my view.  I no longer think that punishing sexually active women is the main point of the anti-abortion movement.  The disconnect between anti-abortion beliefs and the lack of desire for policies to support young women/mothers are coincidentally held by many people, but the second belief does not mean that people are insincere about their belief in the first.  Perhaps illogical, but not insincere.

Note that this does not change my point of view of being pro-choice, which is based on a belief that an embryo/fetus is a potential human, but not an actual human early in development and that choices should be left between women and their doctors.  Nor does it change my option that improved policies to support reducing the cost of birth control and providing aid to families in need would be effective in reducing the number of abortions.

481,CMV: Any food past recommended daily values should be heavily taxes,FALSE,0,t3_3f0r6b,"I'm not here to argue how this would be implemented. There would obviously be challenges in that sense but I'm sure rationing could be done in the digital age.

There's millions of people starving every day, yet in countries where people make slightly above average are permitted to deplete the world's food supply, waste food, and pretty much cut in line in front of others for having money. Food that could be used by poor regions is instead shipped out to feed those who can afford it. 

Then there's the fact that obesity has increased, at least within the US, in the past decade. Our only real solution has been to attempt to tax soft drinks or try to hurt corporations who make ""unhealthy"" food, but that does not directly treat the problem, which is over-eating. I'm sure we can all agree that if you become overweight that shows that your body has more food than it requires to live. When people are permitted to purchase as much food as they want, no matter how healthy the food ends up being, they will gain weight. This in turn causes more problems and costs money in healthcare. 

Food should be taxed/rationed. Based on what is factually calculated (for example, with a doctor's visit) on how much you need to consume, you should be *encouraged* (not forced) to eat the proper amount monetarily. Since eating excessively damages those who cannot afford food due to inflated food prices, as well as costs others by your deteriorating health, a tax is a reasonable/viable option. 

Just like you're not permitted to do harmful drugs (for the most part) or permitted to kill yourself or harm yourself (for the most part) this would at the very least be another measure to keeping people in our society healthy and from also damaging others. Since it would not be forced, you're technically still permitted to eat more food, however, you should be able to prove that you can afford your lifestyle that causes health issues and issues for others, and support the system by paying a tax, which could then be used to feed the homeless and fund welfare programs.


Here's an article of something similar in place and proof that it's effective:

478,"CMV: Hearthstone and its card economy is incredibly unbalanced and shallow, especially after the Gnomes vs. Goblins expansion.",TRUE,1,t3_3f16ju,"I have played Hearthstone since its beta and have had great times with it (I still do).

My massive issue with the game is that the current meta relies too heavily on strung together mech cards that perfectly mesh with each other and do no evoke a skill-based theme or tactic. The expansion has encouraged players to make decks that kill quickly before the game can even begin to get interesting; this avoids the entirety of what makes Hearthstone special.

Another thing is that Legendaries are totally whack as a core concept. They come off as useful tools to take out foes but are secretly a ploy to get ""consumers"" to buy packs to try and earn them (in a free-to-play game). The rarity of these cards even further prove that it benefits those who purchase packs in bulk and get them quicker, letting them get ""better"" faster and leave other players in the dust.

Blizzard has also recently lowered the chance of getting decent dailies, meaning you have a lower chance of generating in game currency, further benefiting the payers.

Cards involving random chance while also altering the mana curve (Voidcaller, Unstoppable Portal, Alarm-o-Bot) are devastating and should not exist. This is different than Druid's mana increasing cards as this is a calculated strategy that is understood by the opponent.

671,CMV: Superhero movies are cancer for modern cinema,FALSE,0,t3_3dfzq4,"When I look to modern Cinema, I see a huge tumor, in the middle. Basicly, all-of-yours Avengers, Iron-mans or Suicide-Squats-things. My problem is that I cant see the point or the reason for watching, or even creating sort-of-these high-budget low-artform movies. 


One thing I wont get is why people watching these movies, their reboots over and over past decades. I can accept that old spiderman movies from early 2000s are childhood for some people and I fully respect it.  But what is gonna give you when you make reboot (like latest spiderman honestly), which is ruining franchise? Are you aiming for lower-age audience? Are doing it JUST for money? Dont know the answer.

Then, there comes a popularity of those movies. Did we came to stage that we are going to Cinema only for those ""films"" but killing the rest of the cinema originality? When you come to that stage, Hollywood biggest studios have only concern for this type of extremly profitable movies and loosing care of ""true movies"".

Then, I cant stand the marketing of the movies. You can see list of next superhero movies by marvel or DC for next 10 years, whats the point of that? That you will see next 10 same bad movies only with different villain? **By my point, when you are longering the franchise for long as possible, you are fooling your fans.**

Then, there is a Superhero films in nutshell: People (or heroes, avengers, what-so-ever) are doing extremly unlogical decisions, killing people like robots (no emotion in there) and just killing villains, prepairing for it or just making their way of their personal problems. This is same for most of the movies. (If I didnt saw some best superhero movie, whitch doesnt do wrong these things, reccommend me one). 

For once in while, I can see a good superhero movie, like Batman trilogy from Christopher Nolan. They are doing same things (beating villains, prepairing....) but they are doing it in way to respect the franchise. And its offen rare that someone like Nolan will accept a offer for another superhero blockbuster. 

Am I too old, or the movies are for 12year olds (like MLP), but adults love it anyway? Can someone tell me? Besides that, please dont look at my grammar. Its extremly late and Im tired as hell.

Thanks, and CMV :).

**Edit 1: Much thanks for really great amount of replies and CMVs, I dont know if I can answer them all as well (maybe sometime). CMV community somehow explained to me how big is lore behind ""SH movies"", or how helpful they can be for people who cant read comics. BUT, I AM NOT SATISFIED with one thing. WHY these movies are people prefering then something new and fresh, why they want to see same exact movies for next 10 years or why ""casual viewers"" dont try something new.  Thanks for each letter your write.**

634,"CMV: The UK fox-hunting ban, as it currently stands, is inconsistent and nonsensical.",TRUE,1,t3_3dr44t,"*Disclaimer: I'm unsure what the conventions are for this, but I decided not to go source-hunting for the various statements I'm about to make, with the understanding that if anyone disputes them, they should be able to find sources to the contrary (this being CMV, after all). If this isn't the case, let me know.*

A bit of background for anyone who doesn't know: a few years ago, the UK parliament issued a ban on fox-hunting with dogs. That is to say, you can now no longer deliberately set dogs to chase a fox, and subsequently allow them to kill it.

My contention is that the sole reason for this legislation is to 'spite' the upper-class practitioners of the 'sport' of fox-hunting (which I am not a part of, to be clear), which usually takes place in the form of a grand hunt with hordes of dogs, horses, horn blowing etc.

My reason for this is quite simple: though ostensibly designed to prevent animal cruelty, foxes are still classed as vermin in the UK. This means that you can legally kill them in the wild, without any reason, by pretty much any means you like. This includes snaring, a common method employed by farms, whereupon a trap is laid to catch the fox's leg in a loop of wire, restricting its movement and causing it to starve to death over a period of several days. Other traps and poisons can also be used, and I can say from experience in a rural environment that regulations are non-existent in practise.

The argument made by proponents is that, for the fox, being hunted in the manner I described is truly terrifying, and the dogs proceed to brutally rip them to pieces. They tend to use a lot of emotional language about how horrific it is, and make unsubstantiated claims about how these evil fox-hunters paint blood on their children's faces. The best thing is, I don't even need to argue against any of these, because *the ban doesn't even target them*.

While the foxes can no longer be *killed* by the dogs, the hunting itself is still very much legal. Now, the hunters simply finish it off with a gun, or a bird of prey. If they were feeling sadistic, they could even starve it to death over a period of several days, laughing and stroking their *evil* moustaches as it gets progressively weaker and pained. The ban doesn't even do the job they supposedly designed it for, and yet people still defend it.

I would go one further, and argue that even an 'improved' ban that targets fox-hunting more effectively isn't a good idea. The other common argument I hear is that fox-hunting is, by definition, a blood sport, and that as sentient beings, we should have higher moral standards, and not indulge in the killing of animals simply for our own enjoyment.

Now, I totally understand, and personally agree with, this argument. But, foxes and other animals *are still classed as vermin*; they can be killed for *any* reason, or no reason at all. Aside from much broader and stricter animal rights laws (which I would potentially be open to, but this isn't the discussion being had), the alternative (and what people seem to be in favor of) is some sort of ban on the killing of foxes for the purposes of having fun. I'm against that type of legislation on principle; laws should be based on actions, not on whether the perpetrator enjoyed themselves or not.

So, in summary, the ban as it currently stands is ineffective, inconsistent, and in my view, representative of class warfare and government-imposed moralistic regulations. This puts me in some, uh.. ""interesting"" company, politically, despite my otherwise bleeding-heart-liberal views. So please, reddit, CMV.

EDIT: As /u/grogipher points out, the legislation in question only applies to England and Wales, not the whole of the UK. Apologies for any confusion caused.

1508,"CMV: I'm 21, 5'8 and losing my hair. I will always be alone and no longer want to live.",FALSE,0,t3_35jkn0,"I'm 21, an engineering student, passionate musician with 10 years of experience.
I'm 5'8, and rapidly losing my hair. 
I believe I will end up alone. I've only been in one long term relationship, where I settled for someone who wasn't very emotionally stable, this obviously was unhealthy and I had to leave her after 3 dramatic years.
Out of anger, frustration, and a hunger for change I have spent the last few years doing everything I can to maximize on every aspect of my life that I have control over. I dress well, have a good sense of humor and a very outgoing persona (I genuinely love talking to people), I also have one of the best competitive physiques I have seen from years of sports, intense weightlifting, proper training, eating and excercise. I've pushed myself so hard to develop habits that encourage me to be an honest, empathetic, and selfless human being.
I've read virtually every pickup and seduction book out there (while avoiding the disgustingly mysoginist side of that community), and have approached and talked to endless girls without fear (confidently and without anxiety) yet I am flaked on 100% of the time, every single time.

My increasing hair loss feels like a ticking time bomb for finding someone who will care for me enough to look past it before it goes or the Propecia I take kills my sex drive, as my short stature already turns girls away as it is. And it hurts so much that I have placed so much effort into changing the things that I can, when the things that I can't change inhibit me the most.

Yet no matter how hard I fucking try and want to I am unable to force myself to be attracted to girls who aren't fit and intelligent (basically from my experience, girls that are out of my league), probably due being in the physical shape that I'm in and valuing pursuit of knowledge and intellectual conversarion myself.

I don't want to get laid, or bang 100 girls.

I just want to fall in love man, and have someone who lets me love them, and doesn't care that I'm short and losing my hair because I'd go to the ends of the Earth to fight for and protect them.
Because my biggest fucking fear in life, is settling in a marriage with a girl I'm not attracted to and abandoning my wife and kids as my father did to me. 

And the worst fucking part about it, is I'm being broken into pieces by this STUPID INSIGNIFICANT shit when 200,000 Haitians were buried under buildings in an earthquake and I am otherwise perfectly healthy while others are in hospital beds fighting for the opportunity for life that I currently hold and take for granted.

How fucked up is that? 
And knowing that makes me feel like such a small piece of shit man that I can't come to terms with my emotions and get the fuck over it.

I just wasn't built for the mental and emotional battle I've dealt with for years, the loneliness and having no one to talk to, and am searching for a way out.

834,"CMV: I am over 10 years out of college and have a great career. I have a hard time accepting that a driven, intelligent person would fail in finding success.",TRUE,1,t3_3c0rc5,"This is not meant to be a troll post, but an earnest attempt to determine if my views are incorrect or unfair.  I have two minds when it comes to the fact that so many people have trouble finding a job that pays a living wage and is something they enjoy.  On one hand I am very sympathetic and feel that I have been lucky in life to get to where I am.  On the other hand I got to where I am through taking calculated risks and then stacking the deck in my favor.  There was definitely luck involved, but not all the risks I took paid out and I had to move on to something else.  I feel like too many people aren't taking matters into their own hands regarding their own success, like I feel I did, and I simultaneously feel proud and callous in that belief.  I am unsure which one is more correct.

Example #1

I have been on the recruiting side of multiple companies (tech sector) and have been blown away by the low quality/behavior of applicants.  These are the people that get through the resume filter and are invited on site.  Now I never test applicants on specific details of systems, because in practice you look those up as needed on the job.  I asked about what they have done in the past or what parts of their training they were most familiar with and tested their understanding of it.  I have had people that came into interviews and tried to act like they were running the show, people who refused to answer questions I asked, and people not familiar with the most basic parts of what they said they were experts in.  I know this is anecdotal, but the fact that it was so difficult to find people that were remotely qualified in fields they had spent years studying completely confused me.  The bar for applicants was not high in most cases my team was very motivated to find someone to hire.  I could not understand why people seemed to put in so little effort to sell themselves.
 
Example #2

I once worked for many years at a company that was funded off of venture capital around '08, where all investors closed up shop.  There was a lot of pressure on the company and there were multiple mass layoffs that cut staff to the bone and then even further.  I survived all of them, and eventually resigned because I correctly predicted the company would fold in a month.  I was fully aware of the risk of me losing my job and I countered that by simply being very useful.  This was a win-win scenario, because I was an enthusiastic employee and was happy to improve my skills through working on any existing part of the system or try to develop new ones.  Because of this I was more valuable than most of the other employees and had a ton of work/learning experiences I could talk about with recruiters.  Anyone on the team that was remotely difficult to deal with got cut, and I saw their downfall much earlier than it happened.  Now if everyone is being the star employee it would be a different but I have never found a group where that is the case.  For any individual on a team, you don't have to work more hours than someone else to be more valuable than them; you just need to be more friendly, cooperative, and effective.  In my experience that just requires effort and not any special creativity.

Example #3

I started off with a lot of bad habits that inhibited my professional development.  I am very stubborn, so I tend to go down the wrong path for quite a while before I accept that it is wrong.  Despite that, I always honestly evaluated why other people were more effective employees/professionals than me.  In those cases, I would take a step back, forget my ego, and ask myself what they were doing that I was not.  I'd talk to close friends about this to analyze my conclusions and when I figured out what they were doing better I would work incorporate that into myself.  It seemed much easier to mimic the habits of successful people rather than come up with the behaviors on my own.  The fact that I don't see a lot of people doing this completely baffles me.

My experience has been limited to the tech sector but I don't see why this wouldn't generalize to other fields.  Now there are certainly fields where the supply of people overtakes the demand, but I were in that position I would give it my best shot and if it didn't work out I'd move on to something else.  Please tell me if I'm wrong.

edit: from a lot of the comments, I would like to clarify that I did not mean immediate success.  Rather, that one can be driven and follow a path that eventually does not pan out, but that being drive will eventually lead one to success.

330,CMV: Racism has nothing to do with right wing extremism.,FALSE,0,t3_3g4n5f,"Background: I'm a danish libertarian. On a normal left-right scale, I'd be on the right wing, and socialists would be left wing. I'm very ideological, and I don't see what liberalism has to do with racism/xenophobia. 

Libertarians will defend personal freedom and responsibility, because that is what liberalism is all about. I don't see what denying refugees to enter your country has to do with liberalism, nor do I understand why people refer to racists as ""right wing extremists"". 

In my opinion, liberalism (right wing) has nothing to do with immigration/asylum/integration politics. Therefore, it is uncalled for, to say that it is right wing extremists who are against accepting more refugees, as a true libertarian wouldn't mind more refugees, as long as they:

1. Provide for themselves (and/or contributes to society)

2. Doesn't interfere with your personal freedom (example: They don't steal).


Right wing extremism would only be about fully applying the principals of liberalism. For an example: Lowering taxes to 0%. 

Right wing extremism has nothing to do with racism/xenophobia or immigration politics. CMV.

599,CMV: Parents should be allowed to have children with severe mental disability euthanized,TRUE,1,t3_3e5jk8,"This CMV post is partly inspired by this r/relationships [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3e4h7z/i_m38_want_to_surrender_our_severely_autistic_son/) I came across earlier today. This is also a topic I feel somewhat strongly about and I have not had a chance to really share my view on because it's sort of a ""taboo"" view to have.

To sum up the r/relationships post: OP's 4 year old son is severely autistic and OP has been told by doctors that his son will never function above the level of a 1 year old and will require constant care. Son is ruining OP's life and marriage, and is negatively affecting OP's 2 young daughters as well.

I do not believe the OP of that post, and the many other parents who are in a similar scenario, deserve to have their lives ruined just because they were ""dealt a bad hand"" and ended up with a disabled child. I think that euthanasia is a humane, simple solution to a problem like this. After all, we euthanize our loved cats and dogs that are no longer able to have a good, independent life. I don't see a fundamental difference between the two cases.

As for government-owned care facilities: I don't believe it is a good use of our resources as a society to continue to take care of individuals who have no chance to ever become functional members of society. Euthanasia is a much more economically and environmentally more efficient option.

What won't change my view: slippery slope/""where do we draw the line"" types of arguments. We are only discussing cases in which the child is beyond a shadow of a doubt unable to ever function independently. CMV.

Edit: I'm deeply sorry if I offended anybody, particularly those with autism/other disabilities, with this post. Please understand that I am not suggesting that anyone with autism be euthanized. My argument only applied to those who were not capable of basically doing anything besides eating, sleeping, and using the bathroom (with assistance). Anyone who is reading this post is FAR from even close to the level I'm talking about.

661,"CMV: The first goal of the human race, from a currently living humans' perspective, should be to achieve AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)",FALSE,0,t3_3diokb,"This CMV was inspired by this article on the future of AI http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html

I recommend reading it a lot, its a great read, but extremely long.  Anyways, in the article it talks about the rise of AGI, Artificial General Intelligence, or AI that's equivalently as smart as a human (the human equivalent is fairly unimportant, a self-learning AGI would go from the dumbest human to the smartest in a fairly insignificant amount of time).  Anyways, the article then talks about the upcoming ASI (Artificial Super Intelligence) in which AIs would be unfathomably smarter than us.  Imagine how much smarter we are to ants and how a lot of the things that we regularly think of ants can't even conceive in their brains.  That but worse, and the AIs are the humans and we are the ants.  Now the article talks about a lot of implications of this, but one large implication is that it could lead to species extinction, or species immortality.  The former because it could wipe out humans for our relative uselessness (maybe more useful as raw meterials) and the latter because we could either digitally store our consciousness for eternity or rejuvenate our bodies by continuing to reconstruct any bodily decay, atom by atom, quark by quark, etc.  Anyways, scientists have no idea right now what will happen, especially because the AI is so much smarter than us that we can't predict the possible outcomes of what it will do, whether killing or saving us all.  

Because of that, some scientists say that we should be as careful as possible approaching the AI so that we don't accidentally create an ASI that will destroy all humanity.  But for current humans, we're going to die anyways, so the extinction of a human race is just our eventual death that will happen regardless.  But we have one shot at living forever, one way or another, and with our own interests in mind, we should try to get there as fast as possible so that we have the highest chance of achieving our own immortality.  If we mess it up, then we die anyways, but if we achieve species immortality its the ultimate prize, as contrasted to being cautious and dying before species immortality is achieved.  And secondly, if we use the model of our own brains in making this AI, then even if it does kill us all, part of us will love on within AI.  CMV.

941,CMV: Children who do not get 1st-3rd place DO NOT deserve a trophy for simply participating,TRUE,1,t3_3b3s26,"Hello CMV,

I am not a parent but curious as to get your opinions to CMV. I grew playing competitive soccer (worked my way up to the competitive teams from your basic youth teams) and never once received a trophy for simply participating or losing. You either got 1st, 2nd, 3rd or you got nothing it was simple as that. By losing and not being rewarded we understood we had to try harder as an individual and try harder as a team to win. This led me to become much more competitive because I wanted to earn that trophy and be on that competitive team.  I really dont understand the idea of rewarding everyone for not winning, it's almost like saying ""hey, even if you dont try you still win"". I hear stories about teams that go 0-13 in a season and the kids walk away with a trophy, why?  Don't get me wrong, I'm not a cold hearted person and love to see all children happy but I dont understand the concept of rewarding someone for losing or not trying hard enough will result in a prize. To me that just teaches a kid that NOT giving your best will still result in a prize. What lesson does that teach you when you grow up? That your failure or lack of effort will be rewarded regardless of how you performed? Doesn't that give the child a bad mentality growing up? Personally if I had a kid and he/she played a sport I wouldn't allow the coach or a parent to give them a trophy for simply participating, I would make them understand that a reward/trophy is earned by hard work and dedication. I know not all kids are athletic but I still dont understand the concept or idea. 
We all know reality is a bitch and life is going to hit you with some hard lessons so why not teach your kid that hard work pays off? Again, I am not trying to sound cold but I just dont understand the concept of rewarding 
failure/losing, CMV......

Edit: thanks for all the answers, feedback and insight. Many of you helped CMV. Again, I hope I didn't come off as cold or inconsiderate. I have younger cousins and love to see them succeed in anything they do, especially sports. I was more interested in having a discussion as to ""why"" and the mentality behind it. Many of you made valid arguments and gave me some great insight. I'm happy to keep discussing if people are interested but please note I am not against the idea but was more interested in helping me change my view of it. If anything please continue to give your children positive feedback, effective communication, motivation and let them know that team work is a great thing. I recommend everyone put their kids in sports (dont push them into it but help and guide them into something they love doing or are very passionate about). It really does pay off when you get older and helps them build some self confidence and understand the dynamics of a social environment. Thanks again everyone! 

Edit 2: Since the discussion continues, I think children under 12 should only get participation Trophies. Once you hit that age you should be teaching your kids the fundamentals of structured team work, effort and the idea that life will not reward your for simply showing up. Giving participation trophies to kids 13 and above is not a good life lesson. If you care to continue CMV on that! 

Edit 3: Thanks everyone for the continued conversation, input, points of views and personal experiences. This sub is great for people who are curious as to get the other sides opinion and everyone should keep an open mind about changing their view on the matter. Now some last bit of advice for coaches and parents who put their kids in sports. PLEASE keep your eye out for the that one un-athletic kid who might not be the best on the team and make sure that his/her team mates understand this is a team event and that everyone is in this together. Some of these personal experiences shared with me shed some light on how people hated playing sports  and were being bulled because they were that kid and the other kids made them feel left out. Not all kids will be good athletes but you can teach your kids to respect one another, support one another and to ensure that they understand the unity of team work. If your kid is that ""all-star"" on the team then make them understand this most because the other kids will look to him/her to see how they treat the rest of the team. A good leader will understand this and this habit will grow with them, you just have to show them how and why. Thanks again for all the input, this is a great sub. ",941,FALSE,,TRUE,1
1461,CMV: California schools are wrong for banning American flag shirts on Cinco De Mayo.,FALSE,0,t3_36031t,"This issue may have been discussed on this sub but reddit's search is terrible, so I couldn't find anything like it. 
[Watch this video for  some background on the issue](http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Students-Wearing-American-Flag-Shirts-Sent-Home-92945969.html)

I think it's ridiculous that kids cannot wear American Flag shirts on Cinco De Mayo. Schools say it's disrespectful because it's a Mexican heritage day. 
I'm Black and I went to a diverse school, so I know how kids have a tendency to start race wars (especially in gym glass). So I kind of understand the atmosphere. And I think there is some concern that kids who wear American flag shirts on May 5 are sub-textually saying ""go back to Mexico"" or something to that effect against immigrant students. 

But I think the schools is wrong because.


 
1. First Amendment - this argument is self explanatory. 
2. Mexican kids can wear Mexican shirts, but American kids can't wear American shirts? Hypocrisy. 
3. Mexican students should not be offended by American flag shirts. And even if they are, see #1. 
4. I am not a republican in any way, and I am very liberal when it comes to immigration. 
5. If Mexican students feel like they are being sub textually attacked or offended or bullied, they should ignore it. AS long as bullying isn't physical, bullied kids should ideally just ignore it. I understand this is ideal and doesn't always work out in reality. 
6. If Kids were wearing shirts that said ""Go back to mexico!"" or something outrageous like that, that would be a different story, but all their doing is wearing the flag from the country they are currently located in. 

The only remotely acceptable remedy is banning all shirts that have a certain country's flag on them. Yep that includes Mexican shirts too.

Am I being insensitive to issues that effect the Hispanic community in America? If I am please tell me because I fucking hate when people downplay and deny issues that effect the Black community.

12,CMV: Trump is the everyman's candidate,TRUE,1,t3_3j3rdy,"A friend and I were talking about the current candidates and she couldn't understand why Trump was doing so well in the polls.  The best I could articulate it is that he is the most populist candidate out, his politics are moderate but heavily nationalist, his demeanor is one of our idealized archetypes, and he is wealthy but appears genuine, achieving a halo effect (unlike Romney.)  

After realizing this, I asked several other people, and realized that basically my friends, like Clinton, don't like how he communicates, but then have no major disagreement with the content.

Am I missing something?  Is there a good reason to dismiss him as a candidate?  More importantly, who is real competition for him?

***EDIT****
From todays conversations:
I see an argument for why he may not have a good chance in an election (delta awarded), mainly in that whatever percentage of his 25% popularity is republican is all he may get from the republicans, and as a more mainstream candidate arises, the split votes wont go to him (that is, the people who polled for him may be all that would poll for him in the primary, given any other more mainstream republican candidate.

However, I have seen no compelling argument for why he is not a populist candidate.  Some have tried to narrow the definition of a populist to being representative of a position or policies that in some fashion clearly serve the underserve or/and the majority, but this is difficult to define, and ignores the perception.  One person argued at length that the self perception of the constituency as victim and the candidate's policy being to address that sense of victimization is what makes them populist, and while I can agree that it is a fine definition, the person then asserts that this is not trump, and I disagree, as Trump clearly paints the American people as victimized by poor, self interested leadership, a corrupt political culture, and compromised ideas and strategies, and his entire platform is about going in as a normal private citizen and fixing it.

Many (most?) have simply tried to argue that he is too insulting to win, but I remain unconvinced that that would stop a sizable percentage of Americans from voting for him.  This is because Americans don't actually value formality and decorum as much as power and conviction.  For the same reason that this is the America we have, I can't see how a candidate, fundamentally in favor of current nationalist policies, but simultaneously harping on being free from big money interests and the many leadership deficits that are frustrating Americans, isn't hitting so many of the right cords with mainstream America.

If he sticks to a policy (rather than sentiment,) that is antithetical to a group, then another would be preferred by that group.  But a career politician vs Trump, both speaking in vagaries, I see Trump coming out on top rather consistently.  (Saw a headline today, Trump took a hit in polls for being in favor of higher taxes, this looks like an example of the very thing.)

536,CMV: The European left has failed,FALSE,0,t3_3en5e4,"Hey r/CMV,

The topic I'd like to discuss is the current position of the political left, represented by parties such as the British Labour, the German SPD or the Sweden Social Democrats (which are very diverse, of course). Over the last few years most of these parties have suffered significant losses and have not been able to keep up their role as ""people's parties"" due to this. An exception is Southern Europe where parties such as Podemos and SYRIZA attract large numbers of new followers (I suspect SYRIZA will be a huge disappointment for many, keeping in line with my thesis).

Now I think there are various factors to this. First of all, a lot of people in Europe feel their economic situation is worsening compared to the others. Governments talk about ""..% growth in the past 5 years"" or ""the average Belgian is now ..% richer than in 2010"", and I don't claim they are wrong, but a lot of people are not seeing this kind of development. The poor to lower-class people. There's been talk of a widening gap between rich and poor for ages, and it seems that this is taking its toll. The left parties in general seem to have failed in coming up with a solution and sell it to people, even though these should be their main target audience. Besides this they don't have a lot to offer politically (in general; for me they still do).

Another issue is the increasing adoption of traditional left-wing policies by conservative and right-wing parties. Take the FN in France, which claims ""it's neither left nor right"" because they have very right-wing policies (I don't have to elaborate in which areas) coupled with typical welfare state ideas. So to a lot of troubled people, the FN have taken the role of the protecting ""worker's movement"", and in fact one of the boasting points of the FN is that it wants to spend more money on the French poor by cutting welfare for others. In a non-judgmental way, the FN is like a selfish left-wing party. The same you see everywhere, in Denmark etc., where a lot of parties like the DPP or the SD claim things along the line ""there's not enough money, and elderly people go first"".

So why do I not count these parties as ""left"" or ""centre-left""? I don't like the 1-dimensional ""left-right"" distinction, but in the traditional political spectrum the left has also a social meaning. Left-wing parties tend to be very socially liberal (homosexuality, drugs, protection of minorities) while right-wing ones are usually not (conservative family ideals, drugs, etc). Of course a lot of the right-wing parties I've mentioned have moved with the times (the FN is not as toxically anti-semitic and homophobic anymore, Wilders is supportive of LGBT rights), but they are still on the conservative spectrum, especially when it comes to the rights of LGBT people and foreigners. The ""left"" ideal is not to make any distinction based on those things.

It seems that a lot of people can't identify with the traditional left ideals anymore in times like these (which are difficult for everyone) and the right-wing spectrum has been able to take advantage of that. These have been my observations. I've also got a troubled relationship with the left parties in my country, but I consider them my best option. Thus I'm very open to having my view CMV'd, although I'm sceptical as of now. I hope we can have a balanced debate!

1257,CMV: I think that the standard of discourse on reddit would be higher if we were not allowed to root through other users' post/comment histories,FALSE,0,t3_37yxw0,"Whenever a politically charged subject comes up in a debate on reddit, someone will make a good point, and instead of countering it, people will root through his/her comment history and find that they post in X sub, which supposedly discredits their opinion. They even have bots for it now, like the left-wing /u/isreactionary_bot, and the newer, right-wing /u/iscuck_bot. These bots literally root through a user's comment history looking for posts in various ""flagged"" subs for the purpose of calling people out for posting in those subs. I believe this is highly detrimental to the possibility of having a rational debate on anything, because it encourages us to attack the user who says something we disagree with rather than what he/she is actually saying. It's also so tempting that I'll admit that I've done it myself on occasion. If post histories were hidden, or at least hidden for non-""friends"" we wouldn't have this problem.

73,"CMV: The United States is unfairly judged for wanting to stop illegal immigration, when the rest of the world is doing the same thing.",FALSE,0,t3_3ih775,"If you've been following the political hoo-ha surrounding the upcoming presidential election then you are well aware of the controversial topic of illegal immigration. The discussion is pretty clear. The right believes in doing what they can to end it. The left feels that we need to give access to a better life even if it that access isn't attained legally.

Regardless of which you believe, the reality is that every other successful nation is going through a similar thing. If you look at the growing problems with migrants in Greece &amp; Macedonia. If you look at the refuge issues in places in the Middle East like Jordan and Lebannon. You will see that people are fleeing their homelands for the hopes of a better life.

However these hopes come with the destruction of hopes for those who are already in that better land. There are limited resources and giving access to those resources to people who want to come to your country, means that they will not be available for you. This problem is huge and countries are taking varying measures.

Places like Macedonia are blockading their border. Places like Hungary are building fences. Places like Jordan are setting up refuge camps not allowing for access outside of them. 

However when the U.S. suggests that they too need to be taking measures to protect their resources, they are left to handle stark criticism. Criticism that ranges from ""racists"" to ""fascists"". However this same criticism seems to be absent for much of the other countries in the world who believe in protecting their resources and their borders.

I believe the criticism is lacking in Europe because people understand that these migrants are having a detrimental affect on the societies. If you look at the problem expanded immigration has caused in France, Germany, Greece, England and many other nations, you begin to sympathize with taking measures to stop it.

For some reason this reality seems to be ignored when it comes to people over running U.S. borders. It seems as if people think the U.S. has unlimited resources and that any and all should have access to them. 

The narrative is often to say that these people just want to make a better life for themselves. Yes, as does every other person in this world. But in order for them to make a better life they need resources to do so. Those resources are being kept from people who should have access to them (legal immigrants and citizens).

I see no reason why the U.S. should be criticized for wanting to protect the resources and keeping them for U.S. citizens and legal residents. 

Europe's problems should be a lesson that we learn from and try to avoid happening to us. This isn't just a problem that is social, political, financial it is all of that and more. Many experts believe the migrant problem will be the single greatest cause of the collapse of the E.U..  Reason being, there is no plan in place to stop this influx and no European commission to oversee this problem. Countries are left to fend for themselves and they will look out for ""themselves"".

The U.S. should be wise enough to do something about this now or be left to deal with the same faith. 

I don't see why trying to avoid that faith is deserving of criticism. Change My View

1112,CMV: I find it hard to take MRA seriously,TRUE,1,t3_39jwup,"So I am a gay guy and I occasionally identify as a feminist since I believe that women are equal to men in every way and IMO that is feminism.

I know my viewpoint is going to be the antithesis to most MRA's but I just find it hard to take their viewpoints seriously. A lot of the MRA stuff I have seen is complaining on about militant feminists and not Men's Issues. The amount of times I have seen that Toronto incident mentioned, it was 1 crazy group of people, its hardly a world wide phenomena. 

I do admit that there are issues facing on men, stuff like circumcision being seen as the norm in some places (more in the US, they aren't common over in England, unless you are uber religious) and as a guy who has had a male on male sexual assault I know that it won't be taken as seriously as a male on female assault. 

But you don't really see that much of that type of things on MRA, most of it seems to be complaining about Feminism, then you look at what feminism has done compared to MRA. Feminists fought tooth and nail to get the right to vote, chained themselves to buildings, went on hunger strike, went to prison for what they believe in; I haven't seen that from MRA at all. 

I also suppose being gay makes me somewhat sympathetic to Feminism, the queer rights movement has some parallels, I see those first people to resist at Stonewall as our suffragettes 

Edit - At the one who has gone onto my profile and voted down everything on there, great way to make a point... Not. You know Brigading gets you shadowbanned?

767,"CMV: There is absolutely no unrealistic beauty standard, for both men or women.",FALSE,0,t3_3clbs6,"Hey /cmv/, I expect this to be a doozy.

Basically, I see people complaining all the time about the media and their 'unrealistic standards' for beauty.  And I get that the magazines will take models and photoshop the hell out of them.  Okay, of course you can't photoshop yourself like a magazine ad in real life.

But go on Instagram right now and check out some of the girls on there.  And I'm not talking about the professional models who use photoshop, I'm talking about the college girls who get ~~HUGE~~ relatively large followings and tons of 'likes' because they are drop dead gorgeous.  The only thing they are using to adjust their pictures are Instagram filters.

I personally am friends with some of these girls, and they are just as drop dead gorgeous in real life as they are in their photos. Hell, in my opinion these girls look better than the photoshopped ads!

As a result, I don't believe there are unrealistic standards for women to be beautiful, because I see regular girls reach those standards all the time.  

If you are a guy or a girl and want to be more attractive, it's very simple.  Hit the gym, dress well. Done.  Congratulations, you have achieved the 'unrealistic' beauty standard.  

To me, it seems that most people who are complaining about these unattainable standards just don't want to put the time and effort needed to look good.  And hell, I'm one of them! I'm not super jacked or anything. But I acknowledge this is my fault, so I shouldn't feel bad when all the guys in the ads are way better looking than I am.

So go ahead guys, C my V!

1053,CMV: I think it's a selfish motive to purposely try to have children.,TRUE,1,t3_3a44py,"I want children one day. Part of me wants to have my own children but I can't justify birthing my own kids when it's such an extremely selfish motive. Sure, once you've had the kids it's selfless because of how much you have to give up for them. But the initial desire to birth them in the first place is selfish. I want my own children because I want to carry on my own genes. I want to have a little human that resembles me.  As a woman, I want to experience the feeling of a baby inside of me. These reasons are the main reasons why people choose to birth their own kids. 
Here's a few reasons why I find it selfish.

1. There are plenty of children out there without parents. Over 150 million orphans, not to mention foster children. Then here are people who are trying to birth their own when there are so many helpless children without a loving home.

2. There are over 800 million people starving in the world. People are dying from hunger and you're trying to bring another mouth that needs feeding into the world.

3. This reason may be a little unexpected but it's something I'm personally afraid of and so I feel it's a valid reason. I'm agnostic. You can believe whatever you want about the afterlife but that doesn't mean you actually know what will happen to us after we die. Whether we go to a heaven, a hell, are reincarnated, cease to exist or whatever else people can come up with. You just can't  know for sure and anyone who says differently is lying to themselves. Now that being said, say hell is a reality. I hope it isn't but you never know. What if you birthed these children out of your selfish desire and they did just whatever it took to have themselves sent to hell forever. Even if you did pick the ""right"" religion doesn't mean that your child is going to believe it. 


Honestly, I would love for someone to change my mind. My ex and I broke up over this because I want to adopt children and he wants biological children. I just can't morally justify purposely bringing children in the world.

Wit is now completely cliché. You can't go two posts down a comment thread without hitting some example of this. It's the reason so many subs have to adopt a 'serious' tag for posts. Everyone wants to show everyone else how delightfully clever they are. Everyone's got the next best 2¢ joke and can't resist the urge to vomit it out. A zombie mob of narcissistic jesters all trying to elbow their way into the thinnest sliver of limelight. The problem is that there is so much of it now that it all just melts together and you slowly start to realize that maybe wit has had its day. Maybe it's that whole postmodern attitude that's going stale. It's ubiquitous. There's no new ground to be tread. The age of wit and snark is over, or in its twilight. Change my view.

I think a draw system does not encourage offense play. And defensive play is almost always boring. 

In sports with points and a time limit, a system should be used to determine a winner. Be it either a period of extra time, a tie break competition, or both sides should be considered a loss.

Professional sports are a spectacle for entertainment, I believe that this will be more entertaining.

1126,"CMV: If national service was reintroduced to the UK, I would refuse absolutely to participate.",FALSE,0,t3_39fiyx,"There is talk of national service being reintroduced here, and I personally detest the idea. 

  My primary reason is simple- to serve one's country should remain, as it is now, a totally voluntary act. I would personally find it a deep insult if I had signed up of my own volition, only to find myself alongside those who had no choice in the matter. A voluntary act is always going to be worth more than a forced one. 

Similarly I fail to see of what value it is to any young person to do national service. Things like discipline, physical and mental strength, 
teamwork, all these can be taught in ways which do not involve learning aggression also. I would prefer a non-violent approach where young people agreed to civil service, perhaps helping repair roads, plant trees, work on farms and so on, which would be far more useful as well as teaching key skills I've already mentioned. 

Plus given my own personal objections to the monarchy as an institution and also my country, I feel I should not be obligated to undergo an action which involves allegiance to it, given the choice of signing up to the army currently involves a pledge to do both of these things. 

Fact is that I would rather be put into prison, or simply leave the country, rather than do national service. Can anyone CMV?

163,CMV: You should be able to waive parental rights and responsibilities pre-birth.,FALSE,0,t3_3hjlz6,"I think that bodily autonomy is important, however - I also believe that equal rights are important. The way our society is currently structured, a woman has 100% control over what happens to a baby, regardless of circumstances regarding conception. She can choose to carry it to term or she can choose to abort it. The male has few rights and none of them concrete in most countries - in the past, virtually every lawsuit to initiate or prevent an abortion has failed.

I think this is good. I think a woman should have full rights to control her body, and the pregnancy is *definitely* a matter of bodily autonomy. The child that ensues as a result, however, is not. I think, regardless of circumstances of conception, the biological mother/father should be able to opt out of parental rights and responsibilities. At birth, the baby will be delivered/retained by the person who did not sign the waiver, and raised by them - and them alone. Any visitation rights/contact/influence will be at the discretion of the now sole legal guardian.

This way, mothers who don't want the child but may be opposed to an abortion (for whatever reason) can surrender the child to the father without worrying about any legal ramifications. Similarly, any male who doesn't want to participate in the raising of the child should be able to sign a form and waive all legal rights and responsibilities including child support.

This is based on the logic that most pregnancies that are unwanted are either ""accidents"" (I.E. Nobody's fault, condom broke, hormonal B.C. failed, they were stupid and didn't even pull out, etc...) or intentional (Poked holes in the condom, raped, lied about B.C.). I don't believe there are many pregnancies where one party was solely at fault, though I may be wrong on this. As a result, if they choose not to be a part of/don't want that child, I think they should be absolved of pregnancy/birth/child rearing fees.

I don't think either party having to take responsibility for something they didn't want/didn't intend to happen is right. I think that our current system is pretty fucked, honestly, especially because of incidents like [these](http://www.ageofconsent.com/comments/numberthirtysix.htm). While rare, and definitely not the norm, the idea that *anyone* can pay so heavily for something they didn't legally consent to is pretty shocking.

Note: This should only apply to jurisdictions where abortion is legal. Any place where it isn't, both parties are conceivably being forced to bear the pregnancy, and any costs associated with bearing it should be split. That's only if it's going up for adoption, of course.

TL;DR - You shouldn't have to pay for a baby if you didn't want the baby and just got unlucky/were stupid.

47,CMV:People Look for Reasons to be Offended,TRUE,1,t3_3iqguv,"I've noticed that recently it seems like Americans (in particular) tend to look for reasons to be offended. One example would be race (yes I realize that racism is still a thing, and am in no way trying to minimize that terrible fact). 

There are so many things that can be directly attributed back to race or cultural upbringing, but when this is pointed out it is called ""racist."" I think that this is wrong and is making the race issue *more* prevalent than it needs to be. *That sentence is not trying to suggest that the race issue needs to be ignored, merely that not as many people are actually racist as are being accused.*

This same concept can be seen elsewhere, women for example. Women seem to look for areas in which they could possibly be seen as oppressed, even though it's likely that they are not being intentionally oppressed. For example, if a man suggests that a certain job would be done better by a man (which is IMO entirely possible for some positions) that would be seen as sexist an/or oppressive towards women. (To clarify, I'm not suggesting that women shouldn't speak out for their rights to equal treatment - I think that that is very important. I am suggesting that many women are looking for ways they could be offended and being the issue of sexism up in issues that have nothing to do with that).

I think that in America there is a growing ""desire"" to be offended, and that people tend to seek out areas in which they could be offended. This doesn't make sense to me, and I think that it brings up issues that have little to no relevance and actually perpetuates their prevalence.

*Again, really not trying to sound offensive toward anyone with this post. I am aware that I only posted two examples, and I'm sure that I'll get some flack for mentioning only two groups of people - I apologize if I have worded something offensively, and sincerely promise that it was not intended to offend.*

919,"CMV: In light of the recent Supreme Court ruling, the most logical extension of this policy is the eventual legalization of Polygamy and other non-standard marriage arrangements, which will have a negative effect on society as a whole due to the difficulty of defining ""marriage"" or a ""family"".",TRUE,1,t3_3b7rjo,"To be clear, I support the Supreme Court in their decision to legalize same-sex marriage, and I'm happy that rights that have been granted to heterosexual couples are now going to apply to everyone in society. I am, however, mildly concerned or at least intrigued as to where this debate or issue ends.

The reason it's troubling for me is that the most common arguments used to support gay marriage are that ""love is love"" and ""loving who you choose is your right"". What these arguments implicitly say is that the necessary criteria to be allowed to marry is that you love that which you are marrying.

Now I won't delve into the typical response of ""Next thing you know, it'll be legal to marry your pets!"" because I find that particularly hyperbolic and non-productive to the discussion. But I do feel that this open mindset of the definition of marriage will definitely lead to a future debate about what ""marriage"" is.

I believe that the next group to demand legal marriage rights will be polygamists, and that the same arguments of ""love is love"" will still apply. My fear is that despite this good ruling today, we have opened up the door to extremely loose and liberal interpretations of the meaning of ""marriage"" to include anything we want it to under the law.

~~Further, I believe that polygamy is harmful to society and that raising children in a polygamous is harmful to their growth. I believe that polygamy is not a natural arrangement for humans, and that no matter what, it will be emotionally damaging to at least one person in this ""relationship""~~.

But then as I type those words, I realize that the exact same things were said about gay marriage in recent history. So, Reddit, CMV that this supreme court ruling isn't going to evolve into a culture of people being able to marry whoever (or whatever) or however many people they want.

Edit: Let's avoid the moral implications of Polygamy for now. I shouldn't have typed out my personal views on the matter because it's really not what I'm interested in arguing (whether it's right or wrong). I'm interested in hearing legally, why this SC ruling will not lead to a case law precedent used to affirm Polygamy rights in the future. I ask this because all through this debate, most advocates for gay marriage rights said that comparisons of the movement to polygamy were ridiculous.

Homeschooling your kid is just insurance that he/she will be socially awkward, and disadvantaged. Lots of homeschooling involves religious indoctrination, and very one-sided opinions. In public school you are exposed to many different views, opinions, and types of people. These problems would be solved if everyone had to go to public school.

1032,CMV: Humans do not have free will,FALSE,0,t3_3aafl5,"
Hey, Reddit!


I have recently been giving a lot of the thought to the notion of free will.

A concept of free will and moral responsibility is central to religion, criminal justice systems, and many aspects of society.


However, I can not find any way to rationalize the idea, and see no justification whatsoever for believing in it.


My main argument is this:

Any action that we take, thought that we think, etc. is directly caused by a specific physical state of the brain.

Those physical states of the brain MUST be due to some mix of the following 3 things.

1.Genetics

2.The environment in which you were raised, formative processes during youth, etc. 

3.This one doesn't necessarily merit inclusion, but I believe it reasonable to include it as a catch all. If the fundamental nature of reality is random on some level, and this randomness has some sort of an effect on the physical world, then this could possibly be another factor that contributes to the physical states of the brain.


I don't see how anything we do can be explained in any way other than with some combination of the above 3.



If we don't choose our genetics, we don't choose the circumstances in which we were raised, and we (obviously) don't choose #3, then how do we have free will?

382,CMV: The West should fight Islamism by supporting the academic study of Islam and the religious education of Sheiks worldwide.,TRUE,1,t3_3fql48,"**Some Definitions**

**Islamism** - Political Movements that use Islam to justify either their end goals (ie. a religious state, or ""caliphate"") or the means they use (ie. violence, terrorism).

**Islam** - Religion with 1 billion followers worldwide. Draws doctrine from the Qu'ran (a holy book) and the Hadith (the biography of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh)). 

**Sheik** - An educated religious leader that are theological scholars, and have power to issue religious opinions/rulings, known as *fatwas.*



My case is this.

* **Fighting Islamic Terrorism through military force DOES NOT WORK.**
The emergence of ISIS/ISIL/Daesh is strong evidence that foreign invasions cannot create stability in a country.

* **A key feature of Islamic Terrorism is theological ignorance.**
Islam only permits violence in certain circumstances, which are fairly well established. This mirrors a general ignorance among Muslims of what Islam is. This is compounded by the fact that Sheiks pass on their knowledge to students via a mentoring process. Lines of Sheiks are dying out due to a lack of willing students, and knowledge is being lost with them. The pull of Islamism on young men may be contributing to this.

* **A greater understanding of Islam is incompatible with Islamism** - The Qu'ran is a suprisingly thought-provoking text, even for the secular reader. It constantly promotes critical thinking, and warns against interpreting its verses in a dogmatic way. A study of the life of the Prophet (pbuh), where he only fought as a last resort and was firmly against the killing of non-combatants, is totally at odds with Islamists. The fact that modern Islamist organisations (eg. Al-Quaeda, ISIL) are theologically innovative (rather than trying to get back to 7th Century Islam) is something that Al-Quaeda openly admits and is one of their most obvious flaws to Muslim observers.

My solution is that the West, with its traditions of academic study and economic power at the greatest they have ever been, should help educate Muslim countries about their own religion. Education should be at the grass roots level, the theological, and academic levels. I think there is a rather poetic justification in that the Islamic Empire safeguarded many of the texts of Europe and the Greeks at the time Europe was going through its Dark Ages. A similar thing could be argued to be taking place in the Muslim World today. 

**TL;DR** - I think it would be more effective, more sustainable, and it would diffuse the antipathy towards Islam in the Western World. It answers a lot of the current political problems in Muslim countries and would help establish Islam as the progressive force I believe it has always been, rather than the regressive and conservative force people fear it to be.

573,"CMV: What we most hate in others are traits we have, and hate, in ourselves",TRUE,1,t3_3ebqsa,"This is a view I've read about from various pop psychology sources, and it has become conventional wisdom. I believe it contains some truth. Can you convince me it merely reflects the fact that every person has pretty much every trait in them in some form, so if someone says ""I hate X"" they're bound to have some of X in their personality.

An important distinction: I'm talking about ""hate"" that people regularly bring up, like a person who's known for having a hate or dislike of something in particular (something non-trivial, not broccoli or crap movies): **Things that people hate which they think about regularly.**

When people say they hate homosexuals, odds are pretty high they have closeted homosexual desires. This has become a running joke among gay acceptance (i.e. decent) people.

When people say they hate intolerance, you'll often find they're very intolerant of views that strike them as incorrect or un-PC.

Now, take something horrendously evil like pederasty/paedophilia. One of the most heinous, evil, horrible acts possible. Most people I know, however, when asked what they hate in people, don't really mention acts like that. They mention less horrifically evil things: I hate bullies, I hate hypocrisy, I hate rudeness. 

We may want to kill a convicted paedophile with our bare hands, but during our day to day lives we don't think about them often or say we ""hate"" them--we save our long-term hatreds for less evil things. (This may simply be because (say) pedos are so rare and don't show up in our lives very often, or, because people don't hate that which isn't in their own psychological repertoire, or a mixture of both.)

When I say ""I hate religious extremists"", I don't have to be religious to say it, but the underlying trait I hate may be closed-mindedness, which I may hate in myself and which I am afraid of exhibiting. I am 100% convinced I do not have a closed mind, but I cannot easily prove it. Do diehard atheists disprove the idea that what we hate most we hate in ourselves? I also hate animal cruelty, and I've never hurt an animal (knowingly) in my life and have absolutely zero secret or repressed desire to do so. But then again I don't really think about animal cruelty very often, but I do think about other things I hate: petty-mindedness, mean-spiritedness, etc.

Is it all just pop psych bs? I would like a good argument against the idea that our common/over-time objects of hate--particularly a character trait in other people--does not necessarily reflect a hatred of those traits in yourself and a fear that you will express them.

632,CMV: The principle of Free Speech would not be would not be violated by Reddit banning hate subs.,FALSE,0,t3_3ds27n,"For this CMV the [relevant XKCD] (https://xkcd.com/1357/) is not relevant. What I want to address is the idea that the ""principle of free speech"" i.e. Open debate without fear of reprisal would be violated by reddit if they banned hate subreddits. People that make the Principles of Free Speech (PFS) argument are talking about free speech as an enlightenment ideal. I get that, and that may be a fair argument to make. 

My view: 

Banning subreddits is not silencing speech, it is preventing organization. Silencing speech would be a policy that says any users that makes X and Y claims  will be banned. That would be a clear violation of the PFS. Whether or not that is a good idea is not what I am arguing today. My argument, in concrete terms, is that banning coontown is not the same thing as banning white supremacist comments and submissions, and therefore not banning speech. There is nothing to stop a coontown poster from going to r/videos and posting white supremacist comments, or a KIA poster from going to r/gaming posting sexist comments. Organization does not equal speech. 

What will not change my view: 

*Appeals to the first amendment. We have already established that we are not talking about that.

*Slippery slopes (""If Admins can ban subs, users are next"") 

*Bias (""Who gets to choose what subs to ban"")

I honestly wouldn't care if they abolished all public decency laws and everyone walked around naked. However, that doesn't change the fact that the laws exist, and are the basis of my argument. For the people who do get uncomfortable around nude breasts, a single father with his adolescent daughter, or a mother with a teenage son, or even some old stick in the mud curmudgeon, I don't think it's too much to ask to handle such things in private. Whether pumping milk, or nursing at home, there are ways of handling these things. No one else is obligated to accommodate 
public nudity. If it's not ""convenient"" for them, that's all part of the sacrifice of parenthood.

131,"CMV: Much modern and contemporary art (i.e. non-figurative, ""ready-made"", conceptual etc.) is of profound and deeply expressive merit",FALSE,0,t3_3hwvqq,"Thought I would flip the usual ""Modern art isn't real art"" stance around and present a muscular defense of the various 'radical' branches of 20th and 21st century art. Come at me with all you've got about the poverty of modern art! I'm going to start with a rebuttal of some of the common points raised against the worth of modern art, and then list some of the artists I like and why I like them.


So here's what I see as the commonly raised objections to the value of modern and contemporary art (the distinction between these two terms is somewhat ambiguous, but basically modern art is most of what was created from 1900-1960s, and then a shift to 'contemporary' art gradually occurred). 


* No effort/technical skill is required to create it

* ""I don't get it/it's just colors""

* It's not pretty/beautiful

Please let me know of any others you can think of! But, to address these I've listed:


First: No effort is required to create it. Yes, in many cases very little traditional technical skill is necessary to create any number of famous pieces of the last century. And by the same token, often very little quantifiable time or physical effort would have been necessary to create the same pieces. But why do we want art to require technical skill or effort? The answer seems to me that it makes worth quantifiable in terms of man-hours spent or technical skills applied - we assign worth to goods with money, and we earn certain amounts of money based on the time we work at a particular job. That feels simple - but actually we know when we think about it that even the apparently firm valuation possible with money is linked to arbitrary process - the economic status of the country which issues it, political contingencies and emergencies, the variability of market prices for goods and services, etc. And time itself is subject to the same instability - it zips by when we're having fun, and drags endlessly when we're working on a tedious task. Similar insights to these are driving factors in the way the artwork of the 20th century moved gradually away from traditional technical representation of subject matter. When we acknowledge that all processes of valuation are, at bottom, arbitrary, we are liberated from the requirement to adhere to traditional systems of valuation, but also forced to confront the problem of using any system of valuation at all. If all value is arbitrary, can we value anything? Is creation valuable? Life itself?


This brings us the 2nd objection: ""It's just colors/abstract"". A common whipping-boy for Reddit's typical reaction against modern art is Mark Rothko, whose monumental color blocks are often presented as a sort of ""Emperor's New Clothes"". And of course, while there actually is a great deal of technical canvas and paint ability which goes into Rothko's works, traditional figurative techniques are abandoned in them. But we must take note: the 'effort' Rothko is putting into his work is not technical effort but rather effort towards discovering a system of valuation which he can stand on and for after he has abandoned traditional systems. For Rothko, his paintings represented man's transcendental relationship with his own consciousness, a kind of pure, experiential expression of pure Being. It is noteworthy that the dominant philosophical trends of the time were phenomenology and existentialism, which were attempts to find a fundamental ground for consciousness in a newly modern world whose science had demoted God from his throne but neglected to nominate a new Fundamental Arbiter in replacement. So, while Rothko does not use traditional figurative techniques, his work is effortful in the sense that it tries to express a new sense of modern spirituality without God. Variations of the same can be said for much of the various avant-gardes of the first half of the 20th century; traditional artistic valuation was being abandoned (and concrete and universal measurement along with it), but the search for a new ground from and of which to create art was a consuming occupation.


And finally, number 3, ""It's not beautiful/it's ugly"": This point obviously is answered to some degree by the points I've previously made - in dismissing traditional techniques, traditional standards are also held up to question. Beauty becomes something that is not necessarily inherent in a particular nude figure painted with particular colors and brush-strokes, if it is even something to be strived after at all. Duchamp's 'Fountain', among much of his other work, was a fairly direct critique of traditional concepts of artistic beauty, and later Conceptual artists would work with ideas which were in many cases almost totally devoid of physical manifestation, or any object with which to invest with traditional beauty. That doesn't mean many of their works are not beautiful however - the simplicity and poetic elegance of Hans Haacke's [Condensation Cube](http://www.macba.cat/en/condensation-cube-1523) would, I argue, meet many updated standards of beauty; a simple transparent figure which manifests changes in the heat and pressure of the room it is within it, providing a sort of spiritual residue of the minds and bodies which perceive and surround it. In any case, the gist of my rebuttal to this last point is that just as artistic techniques had to shift fundamentally to address our experience of living in the modern age, so did standards of beauty, and even the valuation of beauty itself.


So those are my initial defenses against some of the more common critiques of modern art - please do your best to pick them apart, as well as point out other points that I've missed. Take your best shot! But now that I've put up a defense, I'm going to launch a little offense - examples of some of my favorite artists of the last century, all having worked at some points at least in very untraditional mediums. Perhaps some of you will appreciate these artists as much as I do - and perhaps others of you will gain new fodder for the pointed attacks against my favorable stance towards modern art that I am hoping for!


I love [Marcel Duchamp] (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/Duchamp_Fountaine.jpg). I love [Dieter Roth](http://blog.art21.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/moma_roth_literaturesausage.jpg). I love [Martin Kippenberger](http://www.markorton.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/kippenburger-moma-032809.jpg). I love [Bruce Nauman](http://inhalemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/bruce-nauman2.jpg). All of these artists have in common their use of non-representational artistic techniques. Duchamp introduced the 'ready-made', and irreverently demonstrated the contingency of artistic value through his 'Fountain'. Roth frequently incorporated real food into his work, which inevitably would decompose and change form (and smell). His use of this material points towards the mortality and changeability of things, as well as linking the traditionally abstract realm of artistic production to the corporeality of bodily functioning. One of Martin Kippenberger's most famous pieces is his 'Happy End of Franz Kafka's America', which assembled dozens of pairs of chairs around desks on a sports playing field, with books commissioned by friends of the artists on many of the desks. The work is almost all 'ready-mades', so to speak, with most of the furniture being found and the books written by someone other than the artist, but that's exactly the point - Kippenberger's conception of the creativity of the artist rejected the traditional image of the solitary genius plucking ideas from the ether. Rather, art for Kippenberger was an inherently social function, a variable form of communication of the same type as talking or writing - although a communicative form of imperative spiritual importance. Kippenberger repositioned the artist within the social milieu from which he is at bottom inseparable. Nauman is a mercurial figure who works in many mediums - from sculptures that look like rags tossed in a corner to blinking poetic invocations in neon. What they have in common is an ambiguously anti-monumental sense; if art can be anything, as Duchamp demonstrated, then much of what the artist does in his art studio can be art, as Nauman intuited, even if appears to be trash or built in a gaudily commercial medium, or even if it's simply the act of walking around the studio itself. Here the social role of the artist creates the work as much as the artistic concept. Thus Nauman's dispersed and abject sculptures, or his [lists of neon words](http://beautifuldecay.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/bruce-nauman-1-e1299486791926.jpg) which, as portions constantly blink on and off, modulate to new ambiguities the ambiguity already present in each phrase, demonstrate a freedom of creation bound to the realm of play opened by the identification of the artist with his social role.


OK, so that's enough theorizing from me - change my view! Make me realize that modern art is worthless. I don't care how you do it, but I want to be feeling deep existential dread at the way I've wasted years of my life on a total void by the time I wake up tomorrow morning! Have at it.

However, white collar crimes, blue collar crimes, violent crimes, sexual crimes, etc. are so vastly male-centric that the numbers increase that much. They are both the overwhelming amount of perpetrators and victimized, though women are victimized significantly, as you'd expect, in intimate crimes and sex-related offenses. 

Aside from criminality, men are also more likely to be impulsive and aggressive which is likely to eliminate cohesion and cause undue caution due to the erratic, unpredictably violent and harmful action of this sub-group. 

Why does this persist? Why are men so much more criminal and violent? Does this have a tangibly negative effect on society?

Hence they should be held in high esteem and follow their moral examples, even if we don't agree with their religious views",FALSE,0,t3_3aith1,"Hello there. 

I am a guy from Bangladesh, a highly conservative Islamic country. English is not my native language. I will still try to explain the issue to the best of my ability. If you do not understand something, do ask for clarifications. Furthermore, I do not intend to offend anyone, so please don't take it otherwise. 

I should also say that I am very irreligious, and I am just a Muslim officially. Other than that my views fall in the camp of Liberal Agnosticism. In other words I tend to support contemporary Western social values on morality to some extent. 

Anyways the thing is, I believe that most devoutly religious people are on on the whole good people. If you take a weighing scale and place their good and bad deeds, the scale of righteousness will be many times more heavier than the scale of evil. This would be mostly true for followers of any religion. If someone has lead all their life strictly adhering to their religion, it is highly likely that these people are on the whole *many times moral than the average Westerner or the Common people of the world* 

Since they are many times more moral than the common people of the world, especially the West, these people should be held in high esteem. Even if we don't agree with their views, we should still accept that they are a better person than us and we should aspire to follow in their moral path, even if we do not follow their religious path. We should also place them on a pedestal or have a very high esteem for them and make them leaders among our people. 

I have seen a lot of hatred and mockery towards this group by most Westerners, especially Reddit. People here are always saying ""Dont Preach here, you ****"" and things along those lines. People seem to consider themselves on par or atleast better than devoutly religious people even if they are themselves sleeping around.  

Sure you could argue that there are examples of religious people being criminals, but that is in the minority. This ofcourse does not mean, that their actions against other human beings would be ignored. It would be left to the victim to either forgive or enforce the justice that he owes.

I have not found a metaphor from another person or myself that can be good evidence. All that would be required to change my view is ten or more metaphors that I, or any other redditor, can not find to be ""bad"" evidence as in not actually supporting an argument. There is a large possibility that my terms of a metaphor not being equal enough to support an argument are broad, but I can not think over any way to narrow them down. Edit: Nitpicked was a bad choice of words. My argument is that anyone who uses a metaphor to support an argument or point can not use a sufficient metaphor to make their point. Here, I have found a good example. ""If God exists because you can not disprove his existence, then a magical purple elephant exists because you can not disprove his existence either"". This is an example of using a metaphor in an argument to prove a POINT, very badly. This is a bad use because their is no evidence of a magic purple evidence, but their evidence to why there wouldn't be a magic purple elephant. Any proof that a god has created the universe or that the universe created itself has not been presented making this an example of a bad metaphor in an argument. I am talking about using a metaphor for backing up a point in lieu of evidence.

135,CMV: The black community is perpetuating stereotypes and self-segregating itself.,TRUE,1,t3_3htb3d,"I am a young black male, who is torn between both sides of the aisle regarding race relations in America. 

I have experience racial profiling and understand that there is a prevalent problem with minorities -- specifically African-Americans and Latinos receiving lengthier prison sentences and disproportionately being targeted by law officials. 

I also understand that my experiences do not relate to all of the black community. By that I mean, just because I was able to make it out of the 'hood' doesn't necessarily mean every black person is awarded that opportunity. 


However I also believe that police brutality should not be the pressing issue within the (urban) black community. I believe that the black community is a ''riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma''. And that movements like Black Lives Matter only polarize the country. The American consciousness does not change overnight. 

Obviously I'm not going to be able to go into deep analysis of my views but I'll try touch on some view points.

* Mindset









Black people throughout American history have been disproportionately impoverished, and throughout the last 30 years have developed a mindset of ""hustlin"". Now I understand that ""hustlin"" can translate into any race/culture as just another medium in which to get money. But black culture seems to value poverty and the 'hustlers mentality'. If I turn on the radio to HOT107.5, I am very likely to find the radio announcer perpetuating this stereotype. ""Hustlin'""  is glorified while education is not. 

There is very little initiative towards the Arts, STEM, etc. Sports/athleticism seems to be the major avenue to which black people feel they can ascend from poverty. 

Hip-hop is attached to black culture, and it seems that black culture (which has churned out great literary works and ideas) cannot distance itself from hip-hop. I don't believe hip-hop is bad. Quiet the opposite, but it is the black community that has embraced the hip-hop scene and made the world associate it with us &amp; crime/street life. Even TV shows portray this, everything from sitcoms to drama. You are less likely to find the token-black guy, and more likely to find the 'reformed thug'. 

Black people want to be included in mainstream society, yet reject it at the same time. We want to have black casts in popular TV series or movie franchises, but we also want black-only things. I believe you can't have your cake and eat it too. America works best as a soup, not a salad. 

The black community has yet to tackle black on black crime, yet it sees police brutality as more important. We HATE to be labeled as thugs, criminals, yet social media has only made our stereotypes more transparent.

/r/blackpeopletwitter, albeit funny, is also embarrassing because black people are again perpetuating a stereotype or being cast a stereotype. Tweets about is 'how fire is my mixtape, 'bruh' 'nigga this, nigga that'. We have normalized it to the point weere teenage white girls are saying ""nigga"" and ""bitch"" like it's a pronoun. Political action by black tweeters seems to also alienate other groups of people. The issue of police brutality for example seems to be marketed/targeted as a black-only issue. Again, creating polarizing opinions/slogans like ""All Lives Matter"" 


* Black nationalism

In my eyes, black nationalism is dangerous because it perpetuates a lot of misinformation and half truths. It is on the scale as 'white washing' history. Social media has become a breeding ground for misinformation by/for the black community. Black nationalism will ultimately lead to polarizing the nation.

i.e. ""Ancient Egyptians were black, Jesus was black, Mohammed was black, etc"" or teaching talking about slavery only in terms of black v. white. 


* Homophobia/Racism/Misogyny

As I stated earlier, the black community hasn't made a very active attempt in stemming the mindset that mainstream hip-hop culture perpetuates. All I can tell you is from my own experience but homophobia and misogyny  seems to be rampant in the black community. Not so much in terms of violent actions but insults through social media and subtle homophobic/misogynistic remarks made on radio and TV.

705,CMV: Posting armed guards should be seen as a legitimate proposal to curb school violence.,TRUE,1,t3_3d5kur,"After every school shooting the debate gun violence in schools starts up with one side supporting reduced gun rights and the other side supporting banning violent video games. Whenever the idea of posting armed guards at schools is brought up the idea is always shot down as ridiculous. It was never given a reason why people look down upon it. I feel that posting armed guards at schools would directly deincentivize any individual from going to violent crimes at schools. And if the individual wanting to commit is suicidal than the armed guards would directly solve the problem and stop the would-be gunmen before the tragedy even starts. All other ideas on curbing gun violence doesn't seem to have the aspects of deincentification and directness that posting armed guards at schools has. That's not to say that ideas are wrong but adding this idea of armed guards to their respective platforms would, in my opinion, help curb school violence better than any of these opinions could individually.

edit*: I see that most peoples points are that school shootings are rare and the expenses involved would be to great. That's a legitimate and fair argument. I still think it should be brought up for discussion but I see why people look down upon it.

520,CMV: Politicians (specifically Presidential election candidates) deserve to be taken out of context.,TRUE,1,t3_3eq514,"Recently, Hilary Clinton has been in the news ([x](http://thefreethoughtproject.com/hilary-clinton-the-sight-black-man-hoodie-scary-open-minded-whites/), [x](http://thefreethoughtproject.com/hilary-clinton-the-sight-black-man-hoodie-scary-open-minded-whites/)) after delivering a speech in which she said that ""for a lot of well-meaning, open-minded white people, the sight of a young black man in a hoodie still evokes a twinge of fear."" Publications from across the political spectrum tore her a new one for this comment in perceived poor taste. The article from the Federalist was spread on tumblr, and eventually popular user katara [reblogged with the full context](http://hunty.us/post/125041947641/hillary-clinton-lets-be-honest-black-men-in) of the quote, and people started criticizing the people passing around the articles for taking things out of context / not doing their research.    

(Here's where my opinion comes in.) I think that tumblr's reputation of false alarm and out-of-context sound bites isn't unique to tumblr at all, it's the way popular American media has operated for the last few decades- if not more. [Many](http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2012/09/18/just-the-scandal-of-the-week-or-a-turning-point/the-news-media-and-its-soundbite-culture) [people](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/byron-williams/our-sound-bite-culture-sh_b_93720.html) have discussed the ""sound-bit culture"" that becomes especially popular in presidential election cycles. Given that this is the norm for modern day news, I think politicians have a responsibility to avoid creating problematic soundbites.   

Specifically, I think Clinton doesn't deserve the sympathy she's getting from [people](http://bleecake.tumblr.com/post/125130165347/hillary-clinton-lets-be-honest-black-men-in) who feel as though the media took her quote out of context. Clinton has been a politician for DECADES, she's got more experience than practically anybody- she's gone through 2 successful presidential election campaign as a candidate's spouse and this is her second presidential campaign as a candidate herself. She's been in more controversy over the years than anybody can keep track of. She's got almost unanimous support from the Democratic party, and lord knows she can afford good speechwriters and campaign managers. So why in the hell would she deliver a speech with the sentiment of basically ""Black people are scary... is what a racist would say. Racism is bad."" Surely, she knows people are only gonna take the first bit of that clip, and they're gonna run with it.    

To me, the fact that this ""quotable"" passed through all the levels of Clinton's campaign team is just an indicator of how little anyone working for Clinton (including herself) really gives a shit. She could wake up tomorrow and say she intends on starting a nuclear war with Iran, and she'd still get the Democratic nomination. Because of that, I think the media has the right (and responsibility) to challenge Clinton. A good candidate is a candidate who's speeches can't be misquoted/taken out of context.

1252,"CMV: ""Buckle up, it's the law"" is an appeal to authority, and therefore not a good slogan to get people to put on their seat belts.",TRUE,1,t3_3814fe,"I believe that ""Buckle up, it's the law"" is a very bad slogan, because it is an [appeal to authority](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/appeal-to-authority) which can be rejected easily in people's minds if they aren't aware of the purpose of a law.

Instead, an appeal to the motorist's intelligence by pointing out the consequences of not buckling up, and thus making motorists aware of the possible consequences of not buckling up and making it obvious why it is rather sensible to wear one's seat belt would be a lot more effective. 

[This German ad posted along public roads throughout Germany](http://www.dvr.de/bilder2/p3737/3737_0.jpg) is an excellent example of this. The text translates to ""One is distracted, four die"". A brief but concise outline of cause and effect, enough to raise awareness.

298,CMV: James Holmes Should Be Executed,FALSE,0,t3_3gcsm0,"I am not a death penalty advocate. I realize and acknowledge the dangers of state executions and the danger to innocents. However, James Holmes is guilty. Beyond any reasonable doubt... He took the lives of many others in his madness.

1400,CMV: Hot dogs are not sandwiches,TRUE,1,t3_36fpyn,"[NY tax law classifies hot dogs as sandwiches](http://www.tax.ny.gov/pubs_and_bulls/tg_bulletins/st/sandwiches.htm), but I'm not convinced.

While it is certainly meat with bread on either side (like a hoagie, which is definitely a sandwich), the connected bun and tubular shape of the hot dog make it impossible to lay on the plate in a sandwich fashion:

      bread  
     filling  
      bread  

Instead, the hot dog lays vertically, and then condiments are piled on the top of the tube, in what would be the ""side"" of a sandwich. This is a fundamental change in the mechanic of the food, and it alone would warrant the hot dog's exclusion from the ""sandwich"" family. 

The differences aren't limited to the physical configuration, though. There is also strong social argument that the hot dog is not a sandwich. If you were invited over to a friend's for sandwiches, you would probably be surprised to find that they only had a selection of hotdogs and sausages, along with buns and condiments. A word can be said to mean what people think it means, and most people do not think ""sandwich"" means ""hot dog"".

If you are more of a prescriptive linguist (and so many on reddit are), Oxford Dictionary defines a sandwich as 

&gt;an item of food consisting of two pieces of bread with meat, cheese, or other filling between them, eaten as a light meal

Hot dogs do not fit this description, because the bun is only one piece of bread. The bun is more of a carrying sheath for the hot dog tube, rather than the hot dog being a filling for the bun.

I simply cannot buy that a hot dog is correctly classified as a sandwich. Please, change my view!",1400,TRUE,,FALSE,0

1066,CMV: The state should provide a painless method of suicide to those who want it.,FALSE,0,t3_3a17y6,"The state should provide an easy, painless method of suicide (for example, Nembutal, a barbiturate that is lethal at a certain dose but is quick and causes no known suffering) to those who want it, perhaps with some basic restrictions (i.e. showing that they have had a certain amount of therapy)

People should be free to make the choice to end their own lives if they wish, for whatever reason. This should not be restricted to the terminally ill - anybody should be free to make the choice for themselves. Some people decide that they just don't want to be here any more, and society should accept that.

Currently, society takes every possible action to prevent people from taking their own lives - e.g. placing tight restrictions on certain substances/items, forcibly detaining &amp; ""treating"" people who appear to be ""at risk"" to themselves, even basic discussion of suicide methods is banned here on Reddit and elsewhere. There is a mantra of ""Saving lives at all costs"" - even if the cost is the person's own well-being &amp; freedom. We place far too much emphasis on extending people's lives as much as possible but almost none on actually doing anything to improve them.

This leads to a number of problems - some people are afraid to talk about their problems and seek help for fear of being forcibly detained, or have restrictions placed on them (such as being unable to buy firearms, for example). Someone who has simply decided that they have had enough and just don't want to continue won't be able to discuss their feelings with anyone due to the fear of being labelled ""mentally ill"" and sectioned.

People who are unable to access a painless and ""mess free"" method still take their own lives anyway - often resulting in public, gruesome suicides that affect others (jumping in front of trains, for example) or failed attempts that could leave them in a vegetative state.

""Suicide on the State"" would solve a lot of these problems. People could be more frank about their feelings. Public suicides would be a lot less common. It would far less of a shock to loved ones - they'd get notice, and the person would have the chance to get their affairs in order before their departure - giving notice to their employer, for example. Suicide would have much less of an impact.

359,"CMV:Abortion is not a woman's rights issue, and framing it that way just confuses the argument.",TRUE,1,t3_3fx0wt,"I have never met a person who said they were against abortion because they did not think woman should have autonomy over their own body. Every pro-life person I know says that they are against abortion because it ends the life of a person. Thus, abortion is about when a fetus becomes a person, and if a woman still has the right to exercise autonomy over that person once it is considered such, and if so, is there a limit on when that right could be exercised? 

I do not believe I need to cite people claiming abortion is about women's rights, its on my Facebook wall every single day. Additionally, this is not an argument about whether pro-life or pro-choice is correct , but rather about what the real issue is. The vilifying of people of who want to protect what they see has human life is inherently counterproductive to what pro-choice people are trying to accomplish.

Some of these professions will outright ask on the application if the person has a mental illness.

But people who advocate discrimination against the mentally ill are simply misinformed about the fact that mentally ill people have the same rights as everyone else. While the media portrays mentally ill people as violent, this is simply not true. Mentally ill people are no more violent than the average person.

589,"CMV: In accordance with but-for causality, it cannot be said that viewing child porn (without sharing it) causes harm.",FALSE,0,t3_3e7uht,"I anticipate that this is going to either be down-voted to oblivion or that people are going to try and go off on rants about the wider issue of harm that is caused to children by sexual abuse. I would greatly appreciate if you would take the time to read the following points before commenting or down-voting.

I am not attempting to diminish the harm suffered by children who are victims of sexual abuse. I accept that children are victimised by the perpetrator of their abuse when the images are created and again when and if they find out that images of their abuse are being viewed. 

**My view is based solely on the idea that the causal link between the act (viewing the image) and the harm (the victim being re-victimised) is broken in these circumstances, and that it is impossible to therefore attribute this harm to the person who views the image.**

There is, on the other hand, grounds to argue that a person who actively views *and* re-distributes child porn *is* liable for the harm suffered by the victim. 

Each and every person who shares an image of a child being abused with another person, is ultimately responsible for the image remaining in circulation. Therefore, if a victim of child abuse learns that images of their abuse is being viewed online, then every person after the creator of the image is responsible for that image still existing, since they have created copies and re-distributed them.

Someone who has viewed the image (so downloaded it) but not re-distributed it, cannot be said to be responsible for the fact the image existed when they found it, or that it continues to exist after they downloaded it. Unless the person viewing the image pays to view it or offers a person some sort of benefit in kind other than money, such as for example praise, then him being a passive consumer has, in my opinion, absolutely no impact on the existence of the image on a distribution network. 

A person who views an image of child abuse is only responsible for their behaviour and not the behaviour of others who might view and distribute the same image. A good test of whether harm is caused by a passive consumer of child pornography is to take that passive consumer out of the equation and assess whether the same amount of harm is suffered by the victim. Since passive viewing does not impact upon the existence of the image, if you were able to stop every person who ever passively views but does not re-distribute an image, the image would still exist. The number of people viewing and re-distributing the images would still be the same and they would all still be liable for the harm if the victim in the image was to find out that images of their abuse were being viewed. 

Please don't try and change my view by telling me how bad child porn is, I don't need to be told. My view could quite as easily be about any other topic, except that this appears to me to be the only case where harm is often attributed even though the causal link is broken.

If an unknown white actor portrayed black character with a rounded story, un-cariacatural appearance, etc., and slipped under the radar, why should there be any problem if people find out the actor was white.

Even though I understand why the minstrel shows of the past had been racist, if a black (or any other race) character had been thought to be well developed, not-racist without the context of the character, etc. I don't think it should be comparable to blackface.

195,"CMV: Talking about race, racism, and racial issues along with racial preference programs actually makes any existing problems worse, creates new problems, and divides people rather than unifying them. In my opinion ""not seeing color"" IS the attitude we should cultivate.",TRUE,1,t3_3hcpmz,"In this post I am going to be very blunt. This is because I want to show exactly how all this impacted the thinking of myself and the people around me. I was born here in the US but I am of Chinese and Thai descent. As a child I grew up not really caring at all about race, I just sort of assumed humans came is all different colors and shapes and that was normal. I didn't even know there were names for the different races and ethnicities. The only thing I was really aware of was if people actually came from a different country.

As I grew older, my classmates and I were bombarded with racial messages during school and everywhere else. We were taught that white people were somehow inherently racist. We were taught that everyone else was perfect and every bad thing they did throughout history was somehow righteous and justified. I started to see lines forming. White kids were told that they were somehow responsible for everything some people in the past did. Black kids were taught that they were owed something. I noticed kids start self-segregating. It wasn't anything dramatic, no one attributed this to the things we were being taught, but people knew they were different now. 

I grew older still. I started paying attention to the news and the internet,. Race was discussed alot. I learned about affirmative action and it made my blood boil. If you didn't know, Asians are hurt the most by affirmative action. I would need a MUCH higher SAT score and GPA than a black person to get into the schools of my choice. I started to resent black people for this. Why was I being hurt because an entire race was apparently performing poorly and my entire race wasn't? And if discrimination was the reason, well my race was discriminated against in the past too! This was opinion shared by my friends. It led us to think that if this was the case, black people didn't try very much and were lazy in school. Otherwise why would they need help? I was infuriated to learn that a black girl who took all level classes and wasn't even close to the top of the class was accepted into my first choice college while I was not, despite my excellent grades and test scores. When I went to college, I made sure to avoid going to black doctors and other black professionals for fear than they got their position due to unfair preferences.

I learned about the black crime rate, and prison population. I started to become scared when I saw a black person on the streets. All the commentary about how this was racist merely solidified my opinion. I saw how violent black neighborhoods are, I was catcalled constantly by black men in the streets, I worked in a leasing office and saw black tenants who lived entirely off the government and complained about everything. If I hadn't heard about race my entire life I would have written all these off as ""Man those specific people suck"" rather than lump the entire race together. People address these issues as if everyone else is to blame for these peoples actions, instead of saying hey, those are just bad people. Instead they make it a race thing where those bad people are actually VICTIMS. I heard about the police shootings and the publicity around them. I heard about the riots, and the more people talked about how the senseless destruction was justified the more I distanced myself and the more scared I became. I started to involuntarily see black people as a threat. My friends all secretly talked about how they wished all these people would go back to Africa so we could all live in peace. In the past couple years after all the discussion about race I have seen SOO many non-black people become essentially racist, and so many wonderful black people become entitled and vitriolic.

So basically, I feel like if we brought our kids up to not see color and talk about Americans as Americans, rather than african-american, asian american, etc, racism would soon become a thing of the past. If we keep bringing up race in EVERYTHING, kids start drawing lines and lumping people together as their race, rather than as Americans. They start noticing and being hyper-aware of differences between races. Crying racism in every situation just annoys people and defeats the goal of ending racism. Racial and diversity programs make people resentful, and make the benefitting parties feel entitled. People should be chosen on merit alone. ""Not seeing color"" is treated as ignorant and is laughed at, but I feel that this is the best way to operate if we are ever going to solve our problems.

I'd like other opinions on this because the way I see the world right now truly sickens me. I don't want to keep feeling like I am different because I am Asian, I want to feel American and be okay with the way people talk about race. I want to feel okay with the way we as Americans are dealing with these issues. I also want to understand why ""not seeing color"" is ridiculed.",195,TRUE,,TRUE,1
1344,CMV: BOTH homosexuality and heterosexuality are choices. (Hear me out and CMV),TRUE,1,t3_371t9v,"Hi CMV! A recent post on AskReddit about homosexuality and pedophilia being a choice or not led me to this thought that BOTH homosexuality and heterosexuality are choice made by our subconscious minds. I KNOW how this view will bring up other ethical/moral/rights issues, but read the following before lambasting me:
               
What if the human mind starts as a blank sheet of paper at age zero, but everyone has different genes that give them different tendencies towards different sexualities? So as the human mind engages with the constructed world, as the baby/kid interacts with different types of people, play different toys, watches different cartoons, etc, the mind gets molded accordingly. NOW I know how this opinion will lead to the justification of actions such as churches ""training"" homosexuals back to being a ""normal"" person, but I think that this ""molding of the mind"" only happens to humans before we reach full-consciousness. (Yes, I realize this still doesn't absolve the justification) So, beyond a certain age, the human mind is then more or less ""fixed” and it is then hard to change it.

My opinion is based on little or no knowledge on topics such as human genetics, neuroplasticity, and human psychology. So please CMV!

EDIT: Delta awarded to /u/RustyRook , and thanks for the discussion guys! I now believe that the word ""choice"" isn't the best word to use when it comes to arguments like this. Even if a baby is thrown a bunch of toys and cartoons to play with and watch, s/he doesn't consciously think ""OK, from this moment onwards, I'm gay/straight"" (assuming that the toys/cartoon/culture/environment do even influence the sexual orientation of the child).

1495,CMV: The Next Generation depicts a dystopian future after TOS,FALSE,0,t3_35nmsi,"Okay so this requires a Trek-sized wall of text to even make par for a Trekkie ~~war~~ discussion. I'll break this into two parts to meet the sub's 500 character limit, part II being in the comments section:

**Part I**

Some people absolutely love TNG. For many, it’s their introduction to Star Trek. This makes no sense as even TNG’s writing staff have come forward complaining that Gene Roddenberry thoroughly tied their hands and forced the show to have zero conflict, zero drama, and to resemble his vision of a utopian future, by force mind you. Gene forced the staff, fans of TOS wishing to pay homage to the series, to create utopia against their will via his absolute authority as the creator (cutting out the influence of men like ~~Trotsky~~ D.C. Fontana or Gene Coon, and crowning himself grand chancellor or Star Trek). Let this be a foreshadowing to the sort of show that would unfold.

Even beyond it’s creation, if taken seriously as canon, TNG represents a dystopian future. Take the NCC-1701 Enterprise-D for example. The original Enterprise was just one of an historic line of ships, form the Earth seas to the stars. So why the Enterprise-D, with the same number and name? Why no other ship? Why no Constellation-D, or NCC-1700 Constitution-D? There is no other explanation: It was pure propaganda.",1495,TRUE,,TRUE,1
1130,CMV: 'Privilege' is a pretty self-evident concept. People who deny it are being willfully ignorant.,FALSE,0,t3_39e315,"I legitimately don't understand how anyone could deny that 'privilege' (as a sociological concept) exists. To me, it's so obvious that certain groups receive beneficial treatment as opposed to other groups. On the whole, it's easier to be white than any other race, easier to be straight than any other sexuality, easier to be cis than to be trans, easier to be male than female, easier to be wealthy than to be poor. 

From what I hear, the most common argument from those who deny 'privilege' exists is that (to be reductive) a person with a particular privilege doesn't always sit on the top of the social hierarchy. For instance, a 'privilege denier' will say that privilege doesn't exist because rich blacks have better social outcomes than poor whites, or straight women face less discrimination than gay men. Therefore, white or male privilege doesn't exist, because these are examples of whites and men existing further down the social hierarchy than the people they are supposed to be 'privileged' above. 

I think this is willful ignorance. No one is suggesting that 'privilege' is a zero-sum game, or that some types of privilege are more 'valuable' than others, or that all privilege exists in all situations. Privilege is privilege. A wealthy black man may have a higher income, but that won't stop him being pulled over by the cops or detained when trying to enter his home. A gay man will be subject to homophobic slurs and threats of violence, but a straight woman will be cat-called and endure sexist jokes and sexual harassment.  

Unless you're a black, gay, poor, MtF trans-person, you experience privilege in some portion of your life. You probably don't notice it, because it's the way things have always been. But it's willfully ignorant to say that you're not 'privileged' because some people are in a better station than you are. 

To change my view:

Help me understand why people deny privilege, that isn't rooted in 1.) willful ignorance (citing Tumblr or other sources of bad information on the concept) or 2.) entitlement (""I'm part of a supposedly 'privileged' class: why isn't my life amazing?!?!"") 

I'd like to stay away from arguments from so-called 'privilege deniers' as I think I've explained above why I don't think their arguments hold water, but if you think you've got an argument that dismantles the whole concept of 'privilege': lay it on me.

529,CMV:Men have a more difficult development in life,FALSE,0,t3_3eoimj,"Some people like to argue that men have a more difficult development then woman do.  Here are some arguments they have:

1. ""After controlling for the arrest offense, criminal history, and other prior characteristics, ""men receive 63% longer sentences on average than women do,"" and ""[w]omen are…twice as likely to avoid incarceration if convicted.""https://www.law.umich.edu/newsandinfo/features/Pages/starr_gender_disparities.aspx
This fact does not support the politically correct notion that there is a ""war on women"" in the USA, or that America is patriarchal and full of ""male privilege"".  To the contrary, it says that women are more likely to be protected by society than men, and are given special ""female privileges"" which makes their development easier.

2. In the USA all male citizens MUST register with the Selective Service when they turn 18 so they can be drafted into war if ""needed"" and possibly die. This is a highly sexist law at its core. What would happen if we had a law that only drafted African-Americans, or Latinos, or people with blue eyes? Why don't we draft women? Should we? Some nations like Israel do.

3. If a woman and a man engage in sexual intercourse and pregnancy results, a woman can make decisions that disregards the man’s input but that affect him drastically. If the woman decides to terminate the pregnancy, the man has no legal say in the matter. And if the woman decides to continue the pregnancy, again without any discretion from the man, he is legally responsible for child support for 18 years. If he fails to support such a child he can have his wages garnished and/or be imprisoned. (Please note I AM NOT CLAIMING that a man SHOULD have a legal right here, just that he has no legal standing - it is entirely a woman's choice about how to deal with the pregnancy, and this gives her more control and power than a man in that circumstance) For example, a woman can have the baby and then give up a child for adoption against the man's wishes - http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/12/31/22124881-dad-files-130m-lawsuit-after-son-in-utah-is-given-up-for-adoption.  For another bizarre spin on men's lack of power in these situations check this out; Statutory Rape Victim Ordered To Pay Child Support  http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1996-12-22/features/9612220045_1_pay-child-support-child-support-behalf.

I think this proves that men have a more difficult development in life then woman do.

399,CMV: Approving the Iran deal is in the best interest of U.S. national security.,FALSE,0,t3_3fm8j7,"I don't see a lot of discussion of the Iran deal on Reddit, which is surprising to me since I think there's a good chance it will wind up as the most significant foreign policy development of the Obama presidency.


**Before I launch into my discussion of this issue, let me state the assumptions I'm making about how we evaluate America's national security interests:**


1. The top strategic priority for the U.S. is to minimize the chance of Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon.  This would be considered the ""worst case scenario"" for the U.S. and its Western allies.

2. The U.S.'s second strategic priority is to minimize the chance of the U.S. entering another ground war in the Middle East (i.e. the ""invade Iran"" outcome).

3. The U.S.'s third strategic priority is to minimize Iran's capacity to support terrorist organizations (i.e. Hezbollah, Hamas) and engage in ""proxy wars"" with our allies (basically Israel and Saudi Arabia), as well as to push Iran to improve the human rights situation within its own borders.


My understanding is further that these priorities are strictly ordered, i.e. that 1 &gt; 2 &gt; 3 in importance, and that (for example) we would only want a better outcome in #3 if it did not come at the expense of #1 and #2.  If you disagree with the assumptions I'm making here, I'm willing to discuss them further in the comments.  But I feel pretty comfortable making these assumptions because pretty much everything I've read (both from the left and from the right, both in favor of and against the deal) has made more or less the same ones.


With that out of the way, let's consider the possibilities on the table.


As I see it, when you push past the rhetoric and boil down what proponents and critics of the deal are saying, **there are basically only four options:**

A. Approve the deal.

B. Reject the deal with the intention of returning to the negotiating table for ""a better deal.""

C. The military option-- invade Iran for the strategic purpose of destroying their nuclear program.

D. Do nothing (don't approve any deal and continue with the status quo).


Almost everyone seems clear that C is a terrible option.  As we saw in Iraq, our ability to achieve strategic goals through military force in the Middle East is limited.  We would be committing perhaps another trillion dollars or more, to say nothing of the massive loss of American and Iranian life (probably on a scale far greater than we saw in the Iraq war, due to the more advanced nature of Iran’s military infrastructure), and the end result would be further destabilization of the region and more breeding grounds for terrorist groups akin to ISIS.  Some have suggested an air-war only approach, but this would not guarantee eradication of the nuclear program because of sites like Fordow, which houses a nuclear facility deep in an underground bunker.  Michael Hayden, who had been CIA director under George W. Bush, also makes a credible argument that an invasion would actually *cause* the creation of a nuclear weapon, since they would then pull out all the stops on producing one and we wouldn’t be able to destroy their infrastructure in time.


So the military option is awful.  But in my reading, Option D (do nothing) is almost as bad.  If we do nothing, then there are no restrictions and no oversight on Iran's nuclear program from the West whatsoever.  There would be nothing to stop them from developing a nuclear weapon in as few as a few months.  Israel would likely invade Iran before they let that happen, potentially drawing the U.S. into a Middle East war anyway.  So the status quo is pretty untenable.  Even opponents of the deal tend to concede this.


That brings us to Option B, which seems to be the main conservative alternative to the deal.  The idea here is that we should leave sanctions in place, or even toughen them up, until Iran is forced to agree to a much more one-sided capitulation. 


This sounds good in theory, but there are several reasons to think this is just unrealistic:

* Russia and China are desperate to resume trade with Iran.  Whether we approve the deal or not, they are likely to repeal their own sanctions (frankly, it was amazing that Obama even got them to go along with the sanctions in the first place.)  Therefore, even if Congress passes tougher sanctions, overall economic pressure on the country will decrease, not increase, weakening our negotiating position.
* The EU and our other non-Israel allies will blame the U.S., rather than Iran, for the deal falling through, and may even act to decrease their own sanctions.
* Iran has to appease its own hardliners in government.  The Supreme Leader would not consent to any deal that didn’t include some sort of “face-saving” provision, that lets them propagandize to their own people about their victory over the West.  Therefore, the chance of any deal passing that eliminates 100% of their centrifuges (a key demand of the American right) seems impossible.


The point has been made that Option B is basically the best-case scenario for the *Iranian* government.  If the deal falls through, then they get relief from the economic sanctions that have crippled their country (regardless of what Congress does), they are left with zero international oversight over their nuclear program and are thus free to chug ahead, and best of all, the *Americans* take the blame for the whole thing on the world stage.


Advocates of Option B point out that if we grant Iran any form of sanctions relief, it is likely that they will spend at least some of the money financing terrorist organizations.  As far as I can see, this is probably true  ([Iran no longer funds Hamas](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/palestinianauthority/10091629/Iran-cuts-Hamas-funding-over-Syria.html) but they do still fund Hezbollah, as far as I know).   But I also don’t really see any way to avoid this without compromising Priority #1 or Priority #2, or more likely, both.  


Approving the deal at least gets us oversight, in the form of IAEA inspections, which will have the right to go to any suspicious facility at any time for any reason.  Experts estimate that Iran would not have enough uranium to produce a bomb in less than a year.  If they attempt to ""cheat"" or deny access to inspectors, the ""snapback"" provisions will mean a return to crippling sanctions (and Russia and China won't be able to veto them.)  It's not a perfect deal, but as far as I can see it does achieve Priority #1 and #2 for the U.S.'s national security interests better than any other present option.


If George W. Bush had developed a more coherent Iran strategy beyond just “let’s have some sanctions and eventually they will capitulate to our every demand somehow,” we would probably be in a much better negotiating position (and Iran would be much less far along in its nuclear development.)  He also pretty much destroyed the credibility of any military threat by demonstrating just how unable we are to advance our strategic interests through war in the Middle East.  But given the situation as it stands, I just don’t see any reasonable alternative to approving the (admittedly imperfect) Iran deal.  CMV.

341,CMV: Statutory Rape/Standard Rape laws are sexist and should be completely redone to make the trial more equal. And statutory rape should be abolished all together.,TRUE,1,t3_3g0yd5,"A topic that I have been aware of for a long time has been brought up to my attention again. [This](http://www.wnem.com/story/29722286/young-man-fooled-by-girl-on-hookup-app-wants-off-sex-offender-list#ixzz3i1vo9lzT) appeared on my news feed today and the main key that made me upset was this part of the article was this ""The 14-year-old girl in the case has admitted she lied about her age on the hookup app and said the encounter was consensual, but that's not a valid defense under current laws.""  There is no reason why that shouldn't be a viable defense, I mean, that sentence alone should make any person automatically innocent and the only punishment that should be dealt, if any, should be against the person who lied about their age.

I bring up that rape laws should also be redone. One example was that a youtuber I watch (He wouldn't lie about said things because his whole channel is about social issues and such, and hasn't lied about anything yet. MrRepzion is that guy). He was in a bad relationship and decided to end it. Now the girl was very upset, so upset that she decided to create a fake rape claim, and the only reason Repzion was found guilty, was that his ex mistakenly decided to tell him over text that she claimed a false one, so he had evidence that it was false. Another one was an old friend of mine (17) was dating a 15 year old from my school. He broke up with her, and then filed a false statutory rape case against him, with parental help. Which he plead guilty.

~~I also bring up abolishing statutory rape laws because I see no use for them. If the sex is consensual, then there shouldn't be any punishment, because both parties wanted it, and with how they are set up, I guarantee that the guy will almost always be the one being punished, with the girl off scotch free. And if the sex wasn't consensual, then it should be considered just rape, rendering the statutory rape law useless.~~ Realized this would never be okay.

1253,CMV: Public health should come before civil liberties when it comes to infection control.,FALSE,0,t3_380tly,"Quarantine has been used to manage the outbreaks of communicable disease since the 13th century. The 
purpose of quarantine is to separate from the general population those individuals who have been exposed to and are suspected of carrying a communicable disease but have yet to display symptoms. 

In contrast, isolation is applied to individuals known or suspected to be infected by contagious agents. Isolation separates infected from uninfected individuals during the period of communicability, and restricts their movement to limit exposure of unaffected individuals. Additionally, it allows for the focused delivery of specialised health care to the ill. Quarantine and isolation may be either voluntary or mandatory.

The quarantining and isolation of people often raises questions of civil rights, however a utilitarian view has to be adopted so as to preserve the health of the wider community; else, pandemics can ensue. Where an individual carries a highly contagious infectious agent, the welfare of the public should come before the individual rights of the individual.

491,"CMV:Not wanting to have children due to the state of the global environment is an overreaction, population control is not the best answer.",FALSE,0,t3_3ewj8v,"I had a conversation with a friend a few weeks ago, where I spoke of having children. His response that was that it was selfish and actually quite brutal due to the energy that my offspring would consume in it's lifetime. 

There are simply other ways to solve the environmental problems we currently have. Population control is a completely reactive, knee-jerk solution. 

Slowing down consumerism by giving corporations less power than they already have would be a good start. The big corporates are the ones that are destroying parts of the planet to find more energy and consuming mass amounts of energy to manufacture products. Due to globalisation, the problem we have nowadays is that these corporations are so big that its hard to hold individuals accountable and and they are so powerful that it's hard for the masses to stand up to them. because a lot of the time we think we have a reliance on what they are providing.

Change our attitude as individuals. We need to be more conscious in regards to how we affect the our ecosystems and the planet as a whole. We rarely think about what had to be done to create the plastic packaging from the food we eat, or what has to be done to power our homes. There needs to be more awareness here. Too often I hear people will not recycle because other countries don't and they don't see the point. It is also hard to convince individuals to take this attitude and not leave their lights on when they go out at night when Las Vegas is constantly lit like a Christmas Tree.

It's almost like we need a substantial event to take place before it is indeed too late, the energy issue is starting to pick up traction but we need to move quicker. It absolutely must be on top of every political agenda of every government in the world.

Which brings me to my last point, a friend once questioned why people in third world countries mainly in Africa would continue to have children and that they needed to be educated and discouraged from this as they are contributing to the exponential population growth we are currently enduring. Developed countries consume a lot more than developing countries.

Some of you may argue that countries with larger populations need more energy, I ague back that Indonesia's population is only 29% less than that of the United States. However the consumption of the United States is 95% more than Indonesia. 

I say again, the problem is not the size of the population just the actions we are currently carrying out. There are enough square miles for every human being on this planet ten times over. 

Lastly, I do think there is some legitimacy to this claim. But more people do not necessarily mean more energy consumption. I don't have any empirical evidence and will try to get some but I can bet a family of 6 in East Africa consume a lot less than your average family of 3 in the United States.

812,"CMV: A carbon tax and a wealth tax would be more rational than income, payroll, capital gains and sales taxes",TRUE,1,t3_3c8fiu,"Let's assume that we will never reach consensus on the reality of AGW. We do know, however, that oil and coal are non-renewable resources. It is therefore wise to preserve them for our children. Fossil fuels are also direct pollutants by way of ocean acidification and particulate matter.

A carbon tax would encourage conservation of a limited resource, and discourage pollution. Just in case AGW is real, we would also have hedged our bets there.
 
A wealth tax is equally virtuous because it discourages the pooling of money and encourages it to be pumped through the economy. It whittles away at inheritance and encourages investment (you need your investments to ""outrun"" the wealth tax).

Conversely, income, payroll, capital gains and sales taxes all act as brakes on the economy. All of them ""punish"" things we want people to do: make money, get paid, invest money and buy things.

For example, in the economy I describe, a small time musician would see virtually no taxes except those embedded in the fossil-fuel-based products that she buys. She would pay no income tax or sales tax. Once she went on tour and started using significant amounts of electricity on lights and sound, the event organizers would have to build those costs into the ticket prices. This means that the tour might be a bit smaller and a bit less coal might be burned. This might save the life of an asthmatic or old person.[1]

If she became a ballionaire, then she could ""give back"" to the community through the wealth tax. This seems a lot more sane than taxing her every which way from day 1.

Where is the flaw in my logic?

58,CMV: Many aims of the transsexual community contradict many 2nd and 3rd wave feminist views,TRUE,1,t3_3imbya,"I hear a lot about modern feminism being closely related or even incorporating LGBT+ into itself, and this makes very little sense to me.  


Equality of opportunity can only truly exist if male and female people are perceived as equal in every way as long as  humans and inherent human bias are still factors - this is one issue I have with Feminism in general, but not the point of this CMV. My view is that this directly contradicts the very idea of transgenderism and even to an extent homosexuality in that it removes the unorthodoxy in interaction between gender in non-traditional ways not via acceptance, but by unifying the genders.

 
Ideally, in a feminist world as I see it, genders would be identical in interaction both socially and in work, and biological sex either disregarded or put onto a 'spectrum', in which case transgenderism could be considered a purely cosmetic change (which would be undesirable to undergo seen as the perception of you would not change despite the effort you put in). The current reason as I see it is that they fit better into their reassigned gender roles, which I respect, but gender roles would be eliminated by many feminists, given a chance.

Beacause of this, I see transgenderism as either meaningless in the context of Feminism, or a stepping stone for a pseudo-Orwellian future of counter-constructive normality.

400,"CMV: Sex shouldn't have to require ""enthusiastic"" consent.",FALSE,0,t3_3flv7a,"Recently there has been some discussion about the exact limits of consent where it regards sex, and I am somewhat skeptical about consent having to also be ""enthusiastic"".

Now I could be interpreting it wrong in this context, but that seems like it could lead to some weird situations.

For example, say a guy wants to have sex with his GF, so he asks her. But she isn't that horny, she just wants to watch Game of Thrones. 

Obviously if she shoots him down then that is that. But what if she says something like ""Whatever. I just want to watch Game of Thrones, so as long as you don't block the screen do as you like.""

Does going ahead make him a rapist or guilty of sexual assault simply because she wasn't enthusiastic enough? I honestly don't think so.

How often does that happen? No idea. But given how many people have sex and how fucking good Game of Thrones is I bet it has happened once.

Am I saying it is a good idea? No. Do I acknowledge that sometimes a ""yes"" can be forced? Of course. But requiring ""enthusiastic"" consent just paints with an overly broad brush imho. Maybe say ""not pressured"" or something else instead.

1116,CMV: Molestation is how gays reproduce,FALSE,0,t3_39ijk3,"18% of children molested are boys.^&amp;dagger; 1.1% of the population are gay men.^&amp;dagger;&amp;dagger;
---

Anecdotally, the majority of gay men I've asked have admitted to being sexually abused as a child.

These statistics are only included to reveal what motivates this view, which I admit is both somewhat tenuous and unsettling. I can think of alternative explanations for these statistics, but they to me are less convincing, and I am hoping that another poster has thought deeply about this topic enough to reach some critical insight I may have overlooked.

---

&amp;dagger;
http://www.nsopw.gov/en/Education/FactsStatistics indicates that ""82% of all juvenile victims are female."" From this we conclude that 18% of juvenile victims are male.

&amp;dagger;
&amp;dagger;
Consulting Table 1 on page 7 of http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr077.pdf, we find that 2.2% of men are gay or bisexual. One half of the population are men. So, 1.1% of the population comprises gay or bisexual men.

I realize that the first statistic is not perfectly comparable due to the fact that some boys are molested by women, so I accounted for this and it doesn't make much of a difference:
&gt;""Women are the abusers in about 14% of cases reported against boys and about 6% of cases reported against girls.""

http://www.ptsd.va.gov/public/types/violence/child-sexual-abuse.asp

So 86% of boys molested were abused by men. 0.86*0.18% = 15.48%. That's still over 14 times what we would expect given the assumption that gay or bisexual men rape as often as heterosexual men. There's clearly a link.

---

Note that this has little bearing on my feelings about how gays should be treated; whether you've had bad luck pre- or post-natal doesn't change my sympathy. However, this observation does have a strong impact on my beliefs surrounding, for example, how harshly pedophiles should be punished (with death).

442,CMV: If you decide not to participate in elections you shouldn't complain about the results.,FALSE,0,t3_3f7ohz,"I just had a long political debate with my friend and it ended with him stating that he wouldn't be voting. I believe if you don't vote in the system that you live in, you have no ground to stand on to complain about those elected. I have heard this argument before that the ""lesser of two evils is still an evil"" but I find it a moot point when someone is going to win regardless. By not voting for someone who you could even begin to identify with then you are essentially allowing someone you oppose to run  with less competition.
I understand not everyone has an ideal politician running but if you don't make any attempt to get your say into government, then why would you complain if something doesn't go your way.

890,"CMV: Anyone who actively opposes same-sex marriage based on religious reasons cannot justify it without admitting hypocricy, and in doing so, are likely damning themselves in the eyes of their lord.",FALSE,0,t3_3bk15a,"CMV: There is no way someone can say they disagree with same-sex marriage, based on religious reasons, without being a hypocrite.  Nobody can live their life to the word of the Bible.  At least nobody in Western culture in this day and age.  To live by the Bible to the letter would land whoever did in prison and on death row.

So, with the way that humanity has grown and laws have evolved, people must pick and choose what to follow verbatim and what to shrug off as no longer relevant or possible to follow.  With same-sex marriage (something that is not even mentioned anywhere in the bible), people tend to take a few phrases from the Old Testament and interpret them to say that we should not allow gay people to be able to marry each other.

Now, it is of my opinion that in fighting against gay marriage, unless you're also fighting for every other thing in the Bible that nobody adheres to, you are a hypocrite.  Not only that, but you've chosen a part of the Bible that keeps others from a basic civil right.  If your concern is about the sanctity of marriage, why is there no outcry about the divorce rate or how many people remarry without stoning their previous wife (who they must have divorced because she was unfaithful)?

I see no other possibility than these people dislike gay people for personal reasons, be it that they think it's icky or it just makes them uncomfortable, etc. and have found a means to combat it.  To me, this is exploitation.  Exploitation of the religion they claim to love in order to make their lives a little bit better for themselves.  I do not know if this is considered a sin or not, but as everyone who is against SSM seems to assume that is a sin, I would have to assume that this is as well..... and in all likelihood a greater one.

1104,"CMV: Being a kid in the US, in the '80s, was superior in nearly every way, to being a kid now.",TRUE,1,t3_39m4kj,"As both someone who grew up in the 1980s, and a parent, I have to say that the experience of being a kid back then was better in nearly every way than the experience of being a kid now. The movies were better, the television was better, the music was *way* better, the toys &amp; games were far superior to what exists now, and the day to day experience was better. Back then, social behavior took place in person, not on a computer/mobile screen. We hung out in malls and arcades, we played outside, we actually *did* things instead of posting things. When we went to concerts, we actually watched the concerts live, and not through our phones. 

Now I know that the two biggest arguments people are going to make are technology and the Internet:


**Internet**: Yes, as an adult, the Internet is great, but for kids, I would argue that it's a negative; just one more potential danger for kids to contend with. You ask anyone over 30 if they would've wanted someone filming/posting the crazy shit they did as a kid. This first generation of kids growing up on Social Media is going to be haunted by every stupid post, every bad picture, every idiotic idea, for the rest of their lives. No thanks.

**Technology**:  Again, yes, the tech is much better now than it was back then, but back then, we got far more enjoyment out of our tech than kids do now. For us, the NES was every bit as amazing as the Xbox One and PS4 are now, and we enjoyed them just as much, if not more.  

Kids today are under far more pressure and stress, from far more sources, than we ever were, and because of that, I say, being a kid now sucks compared to being a kid back then. If you want to CMV, convince me that, the overall experience of kids today is better than it was 30 years ago.


&amp;nbsp;

**EDIT**: Comparisons of technology between then and now are irrelevant. Yes, the effects in movies are better today, and yes, video games have better graphics today, but only by today's standards, which didn't exist back then.

1086,CMV: Killing baby cows for food is no more immoral than killing adult cows for food.,TRUE,1,t3_39rlhg,"Cows are neither sentient nor intelligent. They don't anticipate the future, they don't make plans, they're not moved to tears by bringing a new little cow life into the world. Given that killing animals for food is not generally immoral^1 ,  there is not such a great difference between the experience of a baby cow and an adult cow that one will experience death any differently than the other; neither is the life of a cow so rich and fulfilling^2 that it's immoral to deprive a baby cow of it before it dies.

Therefore, I should not feel any worse eating veal than I do eating a hamburger.

^1 If you disagree with this, that's a different argument entirely; I'm glad to hear your opinion on the matter, but you won't change my view unless your argument assumes this point.

^2 Just the opposite, presently; the lives of cows are full of pain and discomfort, because our (American) food-raising process is horrifying. I *do* think that this is unethical, just based on the principle that pain is a bad thing, but it's not a massive priority for me because I think the amount of human suffering is significantly greater at this time than the amount of animal suffering (due to the greater capacity of a human to experience suffering). Again, this isn't the topic of my CMV, but if you want to give your opinion on the matter I'd be glad to hear it.

961,CMV: I believe some God or extra-dimensional entity caused the Big Bang and subsequently our existence.,TRUE,1,t3_3aw1uk,"I attribute my agnosticism to this very theory. Looking at the Big Bang from a purely scientific perspective, we know, or think we know, that there was absolutely nothing in our universe before the Big Bang.

Now of course this nothingness is incomprehensible and even typing this it boggles my mind, but science's explanation is that nothingness caused the Big Bang. Now there are several theories to this, such as somehow two universes rubbing or colliding together which sparked the event. I'm no scientist and I'm sure people will correct me (please do), but the point is we really don't know how the Big Bang formed from what we consider to be nothing.

I tend to think, though, that some conscious entity had to be the catalyst that caused the event. It would seem that if there was nothing in our universe, some extra-dimensional being from another universe would have had to insert itself into ours, which sparked the event known as the Big Bang. I believe the being to be conscious because of the intentional way in which our universe seemed to form, and life sprung up. This begins to err on the side of intelligent design, but I do believe human beings, our consciousness, feelings, empathy, etc, have to be attributed to something higher.

I believe that entity to be God. Not necessarily in the Christian sense, or even that this being is benevolent, but that's my theory. Change my view.

Edited post to clarify that I believe the entity to be conscious and intentional in its insertion into our universe and subsequent cause of the Big Bang and our existence.

1506,CMV: I think Reddit should get rid of the downvote system.,FALSE,0,t3_35jtn2,"I've been on Reddit for a little over a year now. Ar first I really enjoyed the discussion and community. But the longer I stayed I started to notice more and more problems. My biggest gripe with Reddit is the downvote system. I think the upvote concept is good, but not the reverse. As I've noticed, the community tends to silence people they dislike, or have a differing opinion with. This to me goes against the whole concept of Reddit. Content should not be silenced simply because you have a differing opinion. This is why so much of the same content cycles back to the top every now and then. To truly spark discussion and promote diversity, the tool should be removed completely. Though the true problem lies with the users, since they maintain this environment. But just like laws to protect citizens from having their rights taken, equal opportunity to have your voice heard should be a priority. 

But that's just me. Am I missing something?

We are one of the only ones who are in a position where we can help a foreign people. Its like this, lets say you are one of those people who carry a concealed firearm with you wherever you go, and you see someone being raped in an alley at 2 in the morning. To walk away is a terrible thing to do, you have a gun, why wouldn't you use it to protect that poor woman? You are the only one who can! I think we can all agree that when you are in a position of power, you should use your power to fight for the greater good. It is our responsibility to be ""world police"" because we can.

Edit: You guys have some very good points, let me revise my opinion. I was obviously wrong to say that we should get involved in ""all conflicts.""  We should help people's and nations that need our help, and need us to assist them in an unfortunate situation. For example, if a brutal dictator launches an unprovoked attack on a weaker nation, we should help the weaker nation. If a rebel group is fighting a brutal dictator and trying to establish a democracy, we should help establish a democracy. 

Lets say 2 countries both depend on a certain river for water, and the up stream nation takes all the water before it reaches its downstream neighbor. So the down steam neighbor, after trying to negotiate, resorts to warfare, and attacks its upstream neighbor. We should get involved, but not necessarily with force. We should start negotiations to get them to share the water. Or we could help the downstream neighbor develop a new source of water. The point is, we don't necessarily have to use force to solve the conflict. But if the upstream nation absolutely refused to allow the downstream nation any water, than we may have to threaten them with force, and if that doesn't work, then we could use force.

I would argue that there should be certain inalienable rights for individuals by law, including the right ownership of all data (so a company cannot store your data indefinitely without consent, and cannot resell without consent). There should also be the right to take legal proceedings for breach of common or statute law, or for a breach of statutory duty, and these rights can never be violated or amended.

No company should ever be above the law, and it should be illegal to have contract terms that cause someone to restrict their legal freedoms.

126,"CMV: It is not vain to listen to, and enjoy your own music that you've created.",FALSE,0,t3_3hzmz3,"I often come across people that react to an artist listening to, and really being into their own music, as being a vain person. Like they are so in love with themselves.

However, when an artist creates music, what they are doing, is just creating exactly what they want to hear. Their guide for what they decide what to do is whether or not they like it. If they don't like something, they change it, or re-work it. 

So, when an artist creates music, it makes perfect sense that it would be music they would really enjoy listening to. 

It's like making a sandwich. When you make a sandwich, you make it with all the ingredients you want it to have. You choose the condiments, and cuts of meat or whatever, knowing how it's going to taste. You might re-work your sandwich to build a sandwich that you really like. But eating your sandwich and enjoying it, isn't vain. It's not like you're in love with yourself because you made a sandwich you really like. 

It's like that with music. You create music you want to listen to, based on your taste in music. 

Just because you make a sandwich you like it doesn't mean nobody else can make sandwiches you like, but it also doesn't mean you are vain, and in love with yourself if you love eating the sandwiches you learned to make. 

So, I don't think there is anything wrong with listening to your own music, or dancing to it, or acknowledging that you like it, any more than acknowledging that you like your sandwich you made. 

Especially during improvisation, because the ideas you are coming up with are often nearly as much of a surprise for you, as they are for everyone else, it's just you thought of it a fraction of a second earlier than other people heard it. And on top of that, they are your honest idea of exactly the type of thing you want to hear, or feel, that's why you chose to play it. Of course hearing interesting ideas that you would never think of in a million years, is also cool. But anyways, CMV!

401,CMV: Reddit would be a better place if they banned the racist/hate/white nationalist sub-reddits,FALSE,0,t3_3flrkb,"Reddit is home to some very large white nationalist/racist/neo-nazi communities. CoonTown got about [500 000 unique views last month](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoonTown/about/traffic/) and has about 24k subs.

These users affect reddit in general and they make it worse. If you don't think they do, then please read through some of this [IamA with a German refugee worker](https://np.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3faghx/iama_german_who_works_with_unaccompanied_minor/).

If Reddit banned all of these hate subs (and any new ones) then of course the users would blow up, but just like the FPH drama it would die down within a week or two. Then these racists would leave and reddit would be better.

Everybody comes to reddit initially because of some link/thread that they got from somewhere else. As long as reddit still hosts large racist communities (and hosts them ad-free no less) then the number of racists on the entire site will only grow. 

**TL;DR - The ban process wouldn't be perfect, but I think that reddit's policy should be ""we don't want racists here. Go somewhere else."" Instead of their current policy which is ""racists are totally fine, please enjoy your ad-free experience which is subsidised by other content"".**",,,,FALSE,0
584,CMV: I think Insurance companies should be able to disqualify people for pre-existing conditions.,FALSE,0,t3_3e8340,"So, every time I see people defend Obamacare, they point out that companies having to accept people with pre-existing conditions is a major benefit. Maybe I'm missing something here, and I hope you guys can help change my mind.

So, in my view, corporations don't actually have to care about anyone. All they care about is money. They are businesses, they exist to make a profit. Absolutely nobody should be surprised by this. They don't have a moral obligation to help anybody or be compassionate or think of the children or any of that stuff. Businesses don't have a heart, just two columns of numbers.

Insurance companies only exist to make money. The way they do that is by investing in different people, at different rates, to end up making more money than they spend. The perfect customer from their perspective is one who pays their bill every month and never gets sick or costs them money. The worst customer is one who is constantly sick and costs them a ton of money.

So when a young, smart, healthy, middle class person comes in for insurance, he's probably a good investment. Odds are, he will make his payments, and probably not develop any serious issues. A safe bet.

Now you have an obese smoker with asthma, poor eyesight, a heart murmur, epilepsy, diabetes, and leprosy, and he wants insurance. Guess what pal? You are a terrible investment! The odds of you earning the company more money than you cost is almost zero. He's a terrible bet and no sane employee should even consider giving this person insurance.

I understand this means these people can't get insurance, but that's not the companies problem. If the government wants to step in an insure people with poor health, that's fine, but I don't see why they should force insurance companies to make bad investments.

453,CMV: Tom Brady is guilty.,FALSE,0,t3_3f4jwn,"I've read the [20 page report released from Goodell.](https://nfllabor.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/07282015-final-decision-tom-brady-appeal.pdf) I've read [Kraft's speech.](http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/07/29/robert-kraft-tees-off-on/) I've read [Brady's Facebook post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/3f0m1w/tom_bradys_statement_via_facebook/) The entire thing seems like a sloppy attempt at a coverup.

The texts/phone conversations between the two equipment managers:

1. One giving the other a ""heads up"" that his name came up in an interview with NFL Security.

2. Multiple references to Brady's preferences of the PSI of game balls and of providing a needle for use.

3. In the context of an exchange about the pressure of game balls, one said to the other that Brady ""actually brought you up and said you must have a lot of stress trying to get them done."" Mcnally's only assigned responsibility regarding game balls was to deliver them. What is there to ""get done?""

4. One expressing anger with Brady states that ""the only thing deflating sun[day] is his passing rating.""

5. One refers to himself as ""the deflator"" and jokes about ""not going to ESPN ... yet.""

6. Multiple requests for autographed gear from Tom Brady.

7. One says to the other ""I have a big needle for you this week."" The response is ""Better be surrounded by cash and new kicks... or its a rugby sunday"". When asked about this message by investigators, Mcnally confirmed that the reference to ""rugby"" meant an over-inflated football.

8. About a week before the AFCCG, one told the other it would be a ""big autograph day for you."" Several days later, Brady signed 2 footballs and a game-worn jersey and handed them to Mcnally in the equipment room.

Brady ordered his phone that had been used the past 4 months to be destroyed. Even though the phone was talked about in the investigation, he failed to tell them this until several weeks later. Brady says it is what he does with old phones when he gets a new one, but he gave NFL investigators an older phone before that. He was told his own lawyer could select the communications off his personal cellphone that were of interest to the league and send them those specific records, so the excuse of his personal privacy is irrelevant. He says in his recent Facebook post that his old phone was broken, but in the appeal he offered no explanation as to why his phone was replaced the exact day the investigators visited.

Brady claims he does not focus on inflation levels, but he always requested his balls be inflated to the lowest legal level. He complained about over-inflated footballs in a previous 2014 game, and in an interview had said 12.5 PSI was ""the perfect grip for him"". His claim is a blatant lie.

EDIT: Prior to the start of the game, Mcnally removed the Patriots' footballs form the Officials' Locker Room without informing or receiving permission from any of the game's officials, then he went to a small bathroom and locked the door even though he had access to the facilities in the Officials' Locker Room.

1503,CMV: Watching the TV Show Game of Thrones is comparable to watching paint dry (Spoilers),FALSE,0,t3_35ljfe,"Watching paint dry is a very simple thing. Going in you know what is going to happen, and you are just watching it unfold. There may be times of error, dripping of paint, or cracking, but in the end the wall is painted.

Game of Thrones is similar in that there is only one conclusion to the story, and while you may watch some of the paint drip, in the end you will see it dry and nothing else mattered.

In the first or second book/season in this series we learn that there is undead coming from the north to end the world. The only way to defeat them is unite the seven kingdoms and defeat them with dragons. This means that only one person can do this: Daenerys. Not a single other person has dragons. That mean there is only two possible conclusions to the Game of Thrones; Everyone dies, or Daenerys unites the kingdom and wins the war. I doubt anyone would bother with the story if the first happens.

This means there is only one conclusion to the story. Nothing else matters. Every other character is unimportant, and will die now, submit to the queen or die in the war. Every villain in the series will die and everything they do is meaningless, as the only evil is the undead. All the story lines will end before the final war with their conclusions being meaningless in the conclusion of the story. Who cares who is in power if we all know there is only one person who wins in the end? Therefore every minor story line has only one conclusion, they die or submit the queen, none of their goals of power can ever be fulfilled. There is only one person who can win or the world is destroyed. 

Just like the wall being painted, the story will end with a simple conclusion, all those cracks and drips are forgotten as the wall is done and they never meant anything. The wall is the white we painted it in the beginning and now it is dry, nothing else effected it in any way.

All watching the show is watching a long drawn out conclusion. Hell in the books, you can tell they made George add some other Targaryen, the once dead kid, because there was no mystery what so ever and no real reason to continue reading the books. People who watch the TV show are easy going, they did not need to add that mystery because people are content watching the paint dry.

Just like the paint, there is only one color, one ending, and one person who matters. Everyone else is just paint waiting to dry, never changing the known conclusion, just passing the time. Watching the show is watching these characters slowly dry the white you know they will with no mystery as there is only one possible conclusion. CMV

1351,"CMV: It doesn't make sense that saying ""bless you"" when someone sneezes is polite.",TRUE,1,t3_36wmyv,"This is something that's always bothered me, all the way back to when I was a kid. I never understood why it was considered polite to say ""bless you"" after someone had sneezed. 

From my understanding, because people believed sneezing was a demon being expelled from your body, they would say ""bless you."" Nowadays, that doesn't really make sense, and I doubt that anybody believes that is the reason people sneeze. 

Now I don't really care if people prefer to say ""bless you"" after they hear someone sneeze, but it's absolutely ridiculous that some people actually get upset, and will even go as far as calling someone out for not saying ""bless you"" after they'd sneezed. They simply had a tickle in their nose and their body was getting whatever particles it didn't want in the nose out. 

Some may say that it's similar to saying ""excuse me"" when they burp, fart, or yawn, but I disagree. Saying excuse me is a way of apologizing for being a disruption, while saying ""bless you"" is a silly way of saying ""I acknowledge that you have sneezed."" 

Saying ""bless you"" doesn't make sense, and while it doesn't hurt to say, I shouldn't be ridiculed for refusing to congratulate someone on their sneeze. It becomes more disruptive than the sneeze itself and it's just silly.

1215,CMV: Terms and conditions for most software should be restricted to a few standardized licenses.,FALSE,0,t3_38gc0d,"Basically everyone that uses a computer has accepted some terms and conditions without reading them. It simply isn't practical to read through the terms and conditions for every $1 app you buy. It would make a lot more sense to do something similar to creative commons, where you have a set of standardized licenses that you can use without worrying too much about the legalese.

Easy to understand contracts and licenses are in the best interest of the consumer, and it's in the best interest of honest businesses as well, as there's less likely to be a misunderstanding of exactly what terms were offered.

Obviously some things are more niche, but if the thing you're buying is less than say $1000, you shouldn't need more than about 50 words to explain the licensing. If it's more expensive than that, you can probably justify having a lawyer look at the contract.

801,CMV: The Civil War was about slavery,TRUE,1,t3_3cbm07,"You often hear the phrase ""The Civil War wasn't about slavery"", particularly from socially conservative people. Take for example this quote:

""Slavery was a “side issue to the Civil War,” said Pat Hardy, a Republican board member, when the board adopted the standards in 2010. “There would be those who would say the reason for the Civil War was over slavery. No. It was over states’ rights.” [Source](http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/150-years-later-schools-are-still-a-battlefield-for-interpreting-civil-war/2015/07/05/e8fbd57e-2001-11e5-bf41-c23f5d3face1_story.html?hpid=z4)

Yes, the war was fought over states rights...**to have slavery**. I believe that those who deny that slavery was the cause of the war have no factual basis for this and are simply saying it to make the Confederacy appear less racist.

I will admit though, I am not familiar with civil war history. So if you can CMV by pointing out another reason for the war, independent of slavery, go for it.

Edit: So my view has been changed, I suppose I failed to realize that it takes two sides to start a war, and while the South was certainly motivated by their want to protect their ""right"" to own slaves, it seems that the North had other motivations in going to war. Thus, it cannot be fully said that the civil war was about slavery, as this ignores the North's perspective on the war.

Their fear is that the display of these sexual body parts is contributing to a decay in public decency. However, in Islamic countries, a woman's hair is seen as a sexual body part and their display is seen as contributing to the decay of public decency. I know that the punishments vary from country to country and it may seem more like a slap on the wrist in america, but I think both examples are based on a ridiculous premise. What is the difference here?

1035,CMV: Specifically choosing to select a woman for the face of a US dollar isn't empowering for women.,FALSE,0,t3_3a99t7,"Choosing a face for the dollar shouldn't be an act to satisfy any given group. Inevitably, a woman's face would've ended up on a dollar eventually, by more natural means, such as an open vote in which a woman won, and in my opinion, that was going to be coming very soon! But now, it's going to go down in history as an act of pandering, in an attempt to 'empower' women. 

Women are not a hive mind, so putting someone who owns a set of ovaries on currency, they are not all affected by it, or given strength by it. Women do not assimilate respect and admiration and add it to the collective, like the Borg.
 Yes, if we grew as a nation during a time that was *not* racist, sexist, and generally terrible towards so many people, a woman could've been president, and easily been on US currency long ago.
*Yes*, women have been oppressed throughout history, but that's not something that you can make up for by suddenly going out of your way to put a woman in the spotlight every so often. It shouldn't be such a monumental deal. 
To me, it's like approaching a black fellow and whilst shaking his hand, saying ""Hello good fellow, I am not racist, and I hardly even noticed that you are of a darker complexion. I am glad to make your acquaintance, fellow valuable person.""

899,CMV: Evolution (or at least the concept of natural and artificial selection) should be taken out of schools for the same reasons that the Confederate battle flag should be taken down.,TRUE,1,t3_3bfsz3,"It is pretty well known that the colombine shooters believed in natural selection, a key point of evolution. Just from their [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Harris_and_Dylan_Klebold) they talk about natural selection in their journals, Eric Harris wore a shirt with the words ""natural selection"" written on it. It is clear that they believed strongly in this idea. 

The thug who shot up the church in SC believed strongly in white supremacy, he believed in racism and the confederate flag. 

I think that artificial selection was used as a justification for such crimes like eugenics, the holocaust ect. Believing that the weak die off is one of Darwins core concepts (Survival of the fittest, the most adapted live, the least adapted die). I think it is much more vile than the confederate flag, (which also used artificial selection, breeding slaves to fill labor shortages was most likely [a thing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slave_breeding_in_the_United_States) and breeding artificially is a form of artificial selection. 


Please, CMV. I feel a tad silly about even holding it, as I know there are differences but I just can't think of any.

Recent films:

* November Man: Senior CIA operative is involved with his target and tells no-one, creating a massive conflict of interest. It makes him go against his CIA superiors.

* A Most Wanted Man: Covert ops spy gets his cover blown by relatively minor political attaché *working for the same government*.

* RED series: zero stealth on the part of agencies in the films and the team of spies. Operative methods seem to be to blow/shoot shit up.

* James Bond Series: Gets things done but in a usually very apparent and traceable way. Prone to get dangerously sidetracked from the mission by things that really don't matter. MI6 is infiltrated pretty often in the series, and there seems to be an issue with operational stealth on their end too.

* Mission Impossible: See James Bond. Substitute MI6 with whatever Hawk works with.

* Kingsman: See Mission Impossible. Substitute MI6 with ""The Kingsmen"".

* Cold Light of Day: Agent tells a bunch of people he's an agent. 

* Bourne Series: Agency who is supposed to track Bourne is pretty bad at tracking Bourne, is infiltrated, is corrupt... Also likes to blow things up.

Spy movie is too often synonymous with action movie, and it pisses me off, since spy work is almost exactly the opposite. *Tinker, Taylor, Soldier, Spy* was a good one though. Most spy movies are more about super soldiers than super spies.

1220,CMV: Some nation's morals are superior to others. Norway &gt; Somalia in this regard,FALSE,0,t3_38ef4w," may appear ethnocentric by judging other cultures by my culture's standards, but actually I'm using logical moral reasoning valid for all Humans, because we have so much in common. Suffering, grief, and starvation are universally bad. Personal fulfillment and health are always good. There's nothing wrong with acknowledging what's working and what isn't, even across cultural boundaries. However, I don't support the kind of ethnocentrism that thoughtlessly assumes my own values are the best (aside from the universals I mentioned).

Some cultures are better at promoting the good and minimizing the bad. Norwegians are better at it than Somalis, overall. The two countries are near opposite ends of every ranking of national happiness.

A Nord could criticize a Somali for honor-killing his raped daughter because Nordic morals are more successful at promoting overall wellbeing than Somali morals.

The reasoning the Somali man is likely using is that consent is not a factor in sex, so she is culpable and profoundly sinful. Honor dictates that he protect his family's reputation by killing her. This conforms to his idea of Islam and is the best way to protect the immortal souls of himself and the remaining ""pure"" members of his family.

The Nord would see a misogynist man selfishly protecting his own standing in the community by harming a disenfranchised girl under the dubious pretext of preserving the purity of ""souls,"" the existence of which no reliable evidence supports. What's more, helping oneself by hurting others should be discouraged because the Nords believe it degrades the level of wellbeing in a society, and they would know-- they're near the top of the happiness charts.

Some people practice critical thinking and do their own moral reasoning. Others follow the less mentally demanding path of tradition. The result is that some people develop moral skills that maximize health and happiness and minimize suffering. Better educated nations do better at this. Norway has great education, Somalia has terrible education. Thus some nation's morals end up superior to others.

755,CMV: Genres are good and being very specific with genres is a positive thing.,TRUE,1,t3_3cqwqj,"Something I see come up a lot in music discussion threads, whether on Sputnik Music , /r/Music, or even a more niche sub like /r/PostHardcore, is that being very specific with genres is an annoying thing. This is an especially large joke in extreme metal discussions where there are multitudes of different sub-genres.

I think these are great. If you like a band with a specific sound and you want to find more bands like them your best bet is to search for bands in the same genre. Being vague or broad with genres is a great way to not find more bands like the ones you're looking for.

For example, say I like Protest the Hero and want to find more bands like them. They have a lot of influences in their style but could be chalked up into the umbrella genre of ""metal."" If I search ""metal"" I will get a *ton* of bands that sound absolutely nothing like Protest the Hero. Even narrowing it down to ""Progressive Metal"" still gets a lot of bands that aren't very similar, like Opeth. But if I search for ""Mathcore"" which is a lot more specific I can find bands that sound a lot like them.

There's no reason for the disdain of genres. No one complains about when movies get a million genre tags ([Example](http://i.gyazo.com/03027ec62e9f2efce7990a56ad3c79e2.png)) but when bands do they get annoyed and I can't see why.

We kept CSG mines out of our community by fighting the actual companies and protesting instead of relying on politicians, the same thing recently happened on a larger scale with the Adani coal mine, an example in the US would be the introduction of bodycams on police and heightened scrutiny of their behavior in general thanks to regular peoples social activism.",148,FALSE,,TRUE,1
336,CMV: The idea that free speech doesn't apply to private entities is ridiculous,TRUE,1,t3_3g1pcd,"Whenever an issue relating to free speech arises it is almost guaranteed one of the responses will be ""free speech means the state can't control what you say. It doesn't mean freedom from consequences from everyone else"". If it's on the internet it is equally likely that this [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/1357/) will be shown. This does seem at first to be a reasonable point of view. However, I believe it is flawed for several related reasons.

The first reason is that underestimates the power of the public. Just because the state is not infringing your right does not mean others cannot. With other rights this is accepted as part of the system. For instance, if a company refused to serve or allow access to black people that would be considered a violation of their rights despite it not being the government. In the same way, you couldn't claim a country has gender equality if women can't be get a job, despite there being no law against hiring women. Unless freedom of speech can be distinguished from those other rights, which I believe it cannot, there can be no distinction between private agents and the state in terms of freedom of speech.

Secondly, the right to free speech includes the right to unimpeded free speech, if that makes sense. It is not enough to be allowed to say what you want, you have to be allowed to communicate to who you want. It makes more tense in terms of letters. Freedom of speech is not fulfilled by allowing me to write letters, it is only fulfilled by allowing their delivery. Using the example from the comic, continually showing someone the door is the same as standing by the pillar box and shredding the letters as I post them.

The final reason is that extreme reactions to someone's use of free speech can restrict it by effectively punishing them for exercising their right. If I punched someone for suggesting marmite was a valid option for toast, would I not be restricting their right to free speech? Equally, if I was sacked for making a racist reddit post, am I not being punished for exercising my right to freedom of speech? I'm not entirely convinced on this point because it might restrict someone else's freedom of speech to criticise or their freedom of association to not have to put up with me, but I would still say there is some validity to this point.

Just to be clear, I don't think freedom of speech should never be restricted but I do think those restrictions should be acknowledged which the phrase ""freedom of speech, not freedom from consequences"" does not. 

Edit: This has been quite an intense discussion. I'm beginning to think there is too much free speech. Seriously though, there has been a lot of good comments and I'll try to respond as quick as I can, although that may be tomorrow for some. I haven't missed the irony of the downvote button being used to disagree on topic about free speech, but I suppose there's always one. I have given out two deltas so far, but they tangential so the bulk of the view remains unchanged as I write this edit.

Some people seem to be confused about what I mean by a private entity. I simply mean someone who isn't the state or acting as an agent of the state. I never meant to imply that I would start talking shit in your living room. Freedom of speech doesn't make crimes less illegal do to be clear I'm not advocating that in the slightest.

Edit 3: Some people seem to be under the impression I want to expand the laws regarding free speech, probably because I'm a neo-Nazi Grand Dragon or something. That's not the case. I think the current situation I more than satisfactory. My view relates to the opinions towards free speech. To sum it up more succinctly, I don't think people can claim to be pro-free speech, when society is more than willing to restrict it. I'm *not* saying the restrictions are bad, I'm saying people should be more honest about them.

A lot of the comments have struggled with what the view is, despite it being repeated multiple times. I'm not interested in acting as reading adviser. If your comment doesn't address the view, I'm not going to bother responding.

/u/Vordreller found this bastardised version of the [comic](http://sealedabstract.com/rants/re-xkcd-1357-free-speech/), and from John Stuart Mill onwards, I agree with the sentiments the creator expresses. If you want to see my argument in comic form, you couldn't get much closer than that.

432,CMV: Dating Sites Shouldn't Have a 'Just Looking For Friends' Option,TRUE,1,t3_3fau90,"**Partial Delta for /u/DHCKris.**

*I'll give you a partial ∆ because I do think that New Friends works as a combination option, but I think my CMV is more focused on the idea of someone who's either exclusively listed as For Friends, or their profile makes it out that they are primarily (nearly exclusively) for friends. I think in terms of actually being useful to users, it would be nice to have some kind of flagging system for this. My main gripe is that all these sites just show you faces and user names, and you don't really know that these people aren't interested until you've already been drawn in.*
___
*This is based on my experience over about 4-6 months of casually using Tinder and OkC, if that helps you form any counter arguments or gives any perspective. Also, this isnt about poly relationships looking for another partner, the scope of my view doesn't even approach that.*

Something I've noticed with slightly surprising frequency on dating sites are profiles that have one of the following kinds of statements- ""Looking for friends, no commitments."", ""My husband/boyfriend knows I have this to make friends, and I'm not going to cheat so don't bother"", ""I just moved here and thought this would be a good way to make some friends"", ""I don't take this seriously, I'm just here for the laughs, really not looking for a relationship"" ... etc...

Personally, I feel these kinds of profiles don't belong on dating sites, and only serve to come off as disingenuous or disappointing. Most dating sites just give you a series of profile pictures and names, and you choose which ones you find attractive to open up and read. The image draws you in, and then the ""Just for friends"" lets you down. To me, this is like someone attending a speed dating night at a singles bar, someone finds them very attractive and wants to see about striking up a relationship, and then they say ""Oh I only came here to maybe find some friends and enjoy people trying too hard"". If you're really looking for friends, there are places designed for platonic relationships- in the context of online communities there's places like subreddits for local towns, there's meetup.com, there's plenty of public Facebook groups for all kinds of interests, etc... 

Going to a place specifically marketed to and called a dating app is just disingenuous. I wouldn't go to Ashley Madison if I just wanted to get a platonic shoe shopping buddy.

78,"CMV: To discourage illegal immigration, a child born in the USA should only receive birthright citizenship if the parents of that child can prove they are citizens or legal residents (but not legal visitors!) of the USA.",FALSE,0,t3_3ifr1i,"I'm not super passionate about illegal immigration policy but I do think the birthright citizenship portion of the 14th Amendment has become a liability on our country and encourages people to move into the US illegally if only to provide a better life for their family. Regardless of their motives; they break the law, and the government should enforce the law of the land. 

Rather than addressing the symptoms of illegal immigration (building a wall), why not address the cause and try to find ways to defuse the magnet. Illegally immigrating to the US will become much less attractive if parents must provide papers or and ID to get birthright citizenship, and by denying legal visitors this right we can also dissuade the whole birth hotel and anchor baby phenomenon (which isn't as prevalent, but still disturbing). 


I believe we have the technology to document all legal citizens and residents and the benefits of illegal immigration seem to have dried up. This obviously doesn't address the 10+ million illegal immigrants already here, but it will do much to help stem the flow of further illegal immigrants from now on.


I'm having difficulties seeing why people would oppose such a practice. Please explain to me otherwise.

612,CMV:Every not economically sustainable political ideology is utter nonsence,FALSE,0,t3_3e2ahz,"I mainly want to challange socialists / communists and libertarians. 

I think that the sole proposal of a economic Idea is pointless in our current world.
There is the socialist approach that would lead to a non competitive environment like in the eastern sector during the cold war. This approach fails when the state has too many payments for salary because the public sector is massivly overstaffed.
A good example is Greece. Furthermore does socialism encourage corruption of officials.
If there is no private interst in consumption of goods no economy can prosper. ( I dont mean grow irresponsible but develop to a certain degree)
Similarly the Idea of a basic income while the majority of people is still part of the workforce is just mind boggling.

The other extreme is Libertarianism.
I know there are modest versions like with socialism. But:
proposals like: cut all taxes, no regulation at all are just utter nonsense. In the current world we live in I dont see any chances for a fair market not governed by basic rules and regulations.
I can understand where the desire for freedom for the individual comes from but I fail to recognize the usefullness for society. When the state has no income it cannot guarantee basic services like water and electicity and the internet. Which would make the idea of ""net neutrality"" invalid. The best interest of this idea would oppose the best interst for all recipients of the impact of the change.

as /u/_stonecoldsaidso pointed out about a month ago.
&gt;When the Free Market fails to account for negative externalities, regulation is appropriate.

And I agree with his idea. Uncontrolled markets can exist as long as there is no impact on other areas of concern.
And I dont see how libertarianism would deal with this issue especially when impacts on the function of the internet and other basic ""public goods"" can disrupt entire economies and even countries.

There might me additional ideologies.


I appreciate your comments :) And sorry, english is not my first language.

888,"CMV: Qui-Gon Jinn should have freed both Anakin and Shmi Skywalker after the podrace, by force if necessary.",TRUE,1,t3_3bkoa6,"When Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan land on Tatooine, they encounter Watto, a junk dealer who owns two slaves, Anakin Skywalker and his mother Shmi. When Qui-Gon learns he cannot buy them from Watto, he gambles for Anakin's freedom. 

I believe that Qui-Gon should have removed both Anakin and Shmi from Watto's control, using force (or the Force^haha ) if necessary. 

Since the Jedi are ""guardians of peace and justice"", they are presumably called to right moral wrongs. While slavery is apparently not illegal on Tatooine, it is nevertheless immoral, and Qui-Gon seems to recognize this. 

I realize that gambling on the podrace was necessary, since it would be wrong to take Watto's (non-living) property by force, even if he was dead. But I believe that once the race was over, and Qui-Gon had obtained the parts for the ship under the arrangement he and Watto made, Qui-Gon should have freed Shmi Skywalker using any means necessary. 

Change my view.

EDIT: You guys are sending in some great responses, I'll try to get them all after I get to work. There's a couple that keep coming up that I have issue with, though. 

Watto was a good master - Yes, but she's still a slave. Being a slave sucks bantha balls. 

Anakin was the only one who needed to be freed - Yes, but Shmi shouldn't have to be a slave forever because she's not important enough to the story. 

Qui-Gon couldn't free all the slaves - Yes, but that doesn't mean he shouldn't free the ones he can. 

Anakin needed to sever his emotional connections - Yes, but it seems like he would be more attached to his mother if she was still a slave billions of miles away than if she was living somewhere safe and comfortable. 

The Force wouldn't work on Watto - Toydarians are immune to mind tricks, not being hurled around the room with the Force like a ragdoll. 

EDIT: /u/Makes_Poor_Decisions changed my mind. Anakin would most likely not have become a Jedi if he could have lived with his mother and been free. While it still blows for Shmi, I can see the necessity of her being a slave for Anakin to be willing to leave her behind and become a Jedi.

35,CMV: The number of seats which a state has in the House of Representatives should be determined by the number of eligible voters in that state.,FALSE,0,t3_3iwrei,"If a state has 18 million people, with only 10 million eligible to vote. Than that state's house seats should only reflect the 10 million people rather than the 18 million people. While representatives claim to be serving all people in their district, they really only care about those who can vote. This is why no politicians care about prisons or orphans. The only reason why politicians care about public schools is because the parents of public school children can vote. This is also why the drinking age has not been lowered. Politicians do not care about those under 18, and those over 18 will soon be able to drink legally and thus once they turn 21 do not care about lowering the drinking age. Until politicians start listening to those who cannot vote, they should not be awarded seats which include those members of the population who cannot vote. To change my view, you must provide clear examples of politicians listening to those who cannot vote, and really taking their ideas into consideration.

No one cares what you say, unless you use an obviously offensive term or slur.

It isn't too much to ask to be civil.",1318,TRUE,,TRUE,1
649,"CMV: If straight and cis people attend a Pride parade, they should spend some of their time there volunteering.",TRUE,1,t3_3dmorm,"Context: I'm a straight cis man with a lot of straight friends (as well as LGBTQA+ friends) who often go to Boston Pride Parade and NYC Pride Parade. I've never gone to one myself (always find out about it a few days after it happens), but I'm planning on going to volunteer at next year's Boston parade, assuming I'm home from school in time.

I personally get a little uncomfortable when I see straight people partying hard at Pride parades. To me, the parades are supposed to celebrate marginalized social groups who are often shoved under wave after wave of oppression and hatred the other 364 days of the year and has this one day to fully let loose and celebrate in the face of a culture who still may not accept them in the way that they'd like. When straight people jump in, it almost feels like they're co-opting the one day in which non-straight people are finally in control. It seems to me to be similar to straight people putting a rainbow filter over their profile pictures - in theory, it might be OK, but in practice it shifts the attention from the LGBTQA+ people who deserve it onto the straight person who steps in. Almost like a ""Look at me, I'm celebrating pride! Look at how great I am!""

And, yeah, to a certain extent I think this display of solidarity is good. Gay/trans/queer rights won't move forward without the support of those already in power - straight people - and it's nice to see people united across gender and sexuality boundaries in order to celebrate how far we've come and prepare for how far we still have to go. That being said, though, I think there's a point at which a display of solidarity becomes less about the people for whom the solidarity is shown and more about the people who are ""showing"" the solidarity. I think that at a certain point, support for the LGBTQA+ community can transition into an exercise in self-promotion and narcissism, and I'm not super comfortable with that.

This is why I think that straight/cis people who participate in Pride parades should spend some of that participation on volunteering. The parades really run on volunteers, and if a straight/cis person spends time doing the thankless task of picking up trash, filling and lugging big containers of water everywhere, or making sure a first-aid tent is properly staffed, it helps show support for the LGBTQA+ community in a way that simply taking selfies with a shirtless parader will never be able to. I think it's a great way to be an ally to the community in a way that doesn't obnoxiously trumpet that allyship, and it might teach people more about what really makes the revelry run smoothly and give them a new appreciation for something many almost take for granted.

tl;dr Volunteering is a helpful form of allyship for straight/cis people in a way that just going to the parade and celebrating is not.

**EDIT:** Just a clarification - I believe that people shouldn't be *forced* to volunteer, and going to the parade at all is still preferable by far to not going. That said, I think that going and volunteering is far enough preferable to just going to participate that it should be pretty heavily suggested for people planning to go.

I can understand why someone for personal reasons would still label themselves as this kind of agnostic during some kind of transitionary phase, in the sense that one is still actively contemplating for which side to side on.

323,"CMV: I don't think I have to go any faster on a highway, and people trying to cut ahead of me going 90+ miles are reckless and putting me and everyone else driving in danger.",TRUE,1,t3_3g646u,"This is a problem I always encounter when I drive on a highway. The speed limit in the most used highway where I live is 70. I usually go at around that speed (give or take 3-5 miles). Now, I have noticed that an alarming amount of people that are driving behind me get impatient and just speed on ahead of me (which is perfect, if there is no danger of crashing). I usually notice that these people are going at at *least* 90+ mph, and they don't slow down.

This just angers me so much, I feel like I'm constantly being put at risk by boneheads that are too impatient to drive on the speed limit.

I commented this to a lot of friends and most of them tell me that I'm wrong, because ""nobody follows the speed limit"", and I'm going too slow. They say it's perfectly fine to drive at 90+ miles on a highway which indicates to drive at 20 miles less. I don't know anymore. Am I wrong? Should I start speeding too?

1065,CMV: Seltzer is superior soda/pop.,FALSE,0,t3_3a18cu,"I have recently realized that plain soda (seltzer) is superior to all other sodas.

1. No health risks! No sugar, no weird sugar substitutes.

2. Great Flavor! You get the popping sensation from the bubbles, and the carbonic acid generated by CO2 dissolved in water provides great slightly sour/bitter flavor.

3. Because the flavor is unobtrusive, you can drink Seltzer all day without getting tired of it. In fact you can replace all water you drink with seltzer, something you can't do with any other soda.

4. Seltzer tends to be cheaper than other sodas.

So go ahead, CMV, what soda should I be drinking instead?

6,CMV: There is no practical reason for any individual to vote in national elections,TRUE,1,t3_3j64aa,"By ""practical reason,"" I mean a reason that motivates you to vote by ascribing a cause-effect relationship between the action of voting and the outcome of the election.  I admit there can be other reasons to vote--social pressure, solidarity, civic pride, etc.  But on a practical level, I can reasonably expect no difference between the world in which I vote and the world in which I stay home, except that in the former I'd have to go out of my way to perform additional actions.  If I'm trying to decide whether to perform those actions, based on pure self-interest, there is no reason for me to vote.  I'm setting this at the level of national elections (specifically thinking of U.S. elections) because it's true that, given a small enough ""nation,"" your individual vote would carry a significant probability of making a difference.  

This is a classic example of a [collective action problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_action), and after considering this class of problems thoroughly, I've come to the conclusion that there is no self-interested practical reason to participate in these cases, barring external motivators (such as added incentives).

874,CMV: Drag Queens are damaging and hindering the progress of Transgender acceptance.,TRUE,1,t3_3bobgh,"I firmly beleive that drag queens are one of the reasons why Transgender people are ostracised from society, and I (speaking as a transwoman) find it
hard to be accepted and understood by a large portion of the population. 

A drag act is just that. An act. It is not supposed to be taken seriously (just look at the bearded lady Conchita Wurst) and as far as I understand
a drag queen isn't supposed to 'pass' in the transgender sense. A drag queen may have a 'female persona' but they are not transgender, it's not a medical
condition.

I'm going to assume that most people in the west know what a transgender person is, and what a drag queen is and can probably tell the difference. But
I am also going to assume that most people don't know what it actually means to be transgender, that it isn't a choice. The only choice a transgender
individual makes is the choice to transition. 

I feel as if because of drag queens and the confusion between a transgender person and a drag act, we're not taken seriously by someone who can't tell the difference. I am not a drag queen, I don't put on an act, or dress ridiclously, nor do I want to look obviously like a man in a dress (the main point
of a drag queen). I act myself, which isn't overly fruity, camp or feminine, and I dress like a typical woman.

If someone outside LGBT circles sees a gay man in drag, they might assume that is a transgender person and therefore treat the issue of transgenderism as silly and as an act, rather than realising that true gender dysphoria is horrific for anyone who has to deal with it. 

I would almost go as far as saying that drag acts are (intentionally or unintentionally) mocking the plight of transgender individuals, and it is akin to dribbling and pretending to be someone with downs syndrome, and at the complete extreme (further than what I believe) akin to blackface.

I want to not hate drag queens, but I can't help but feel that do nothing but trivialise transgender people and make it harder for us, CMV.

808,CMV: reddit could be doing an excellent job with the way they handled letting go of Victoria,FALSE,0,t3_3c91yb,"Reddit execs have been taking a bit image hit over the last few days. The issues are numerous but it seems like the catalyst for the blackout was the way they let go of Victoria without involving the reddit community or communicating with them, and seemingly having no plan of action on how to fill the gap in her responsibilities. 

I believe that perfectly acceptable reasons could have caused this course of action and to not accept that possibility and start a blackout and/or reddit exodus is irrational. 

For example - a few years ago my company fired a VP quickly without having a real good plan on how to bridge the gap before we found a replacement. This individual had referred to another manager(semi-openly gay) as ""the faggot"" in a small meeting. We simply could not tolerate that behavior so we fired him the next day. It wasn't what was best for our bottom line, but it was best for the environment and culture that our company believes in. We didn't feel it was in the best interest of telling the whole company the reasoning for termination and several on that team were very upset by the clearly abrupt and unplanned separation - for several people their impression was ""management doesn't have their shit together"". 

I could imagine several scenarios where Victoria should be terminated quickly and it would not be appropriate to give a reason publicly. I would even say that reddit has been incredibly professional by continuing to remain silent on her termination even when facing the vastly damaging public backlash. ",808,FALSE,,TRUE,1

1102,CMV: I use iTunes. Why should I switch to something like Spotify when I already have an extensive library set up?,TRUE,1,t3_39mibw,"Some of my friends say Spotify is the best thing for playing music. But I find it hard to believe when there are people like me who already have over 1000 songs in our library. Not to mention, iTunes is the only thing that will properly communicate with my Apple product that I use for music.

I realize you can download pretty much as much music as you want, but to get that, you have to pay. Whereas iTunes is free. I'm not really the type of person who's into discovering brand new music all the time. Occasionally, I'll expand my horizons until I find an artist who really sticks, and then I'll play the crap out of their music until I'm pretty much sick of it. Back in the day, when I had a Zune to play music, they had a similar feature where you could pay a fixed subscription fee to download as much music as you wanted for free. Even back then, an offer like this didn't pique my interest.

Knowing this, are there any standout features that evolve the listening experience so much that I'd be willing to abandon my iTunes library and start over again?

Edit: I've decided that I want to experiment with Spotify and at least try it out. Thank you to all the people who replied. You all gave really helpful information.

534,CMV: The government should assist people in moving out of drought stricken parts of the US. It'd be cheaper and safer in the long run than waiting.,FALSE,0,t3_3en6ub," I think all people should be given assistance moving out of [extremely drought stricken areas](http://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/Home/RegionalDroughtMonitor.aspx?west) of the US. Reasons to move them: 

* the drought is expected to continue for quite a while. The areas were never suitable for supporting large populations and production in the first place. 

* The move could be used to stimulate economic growth in the places people are moved to. 

* Lowering the population even by a fraction would loosen the demands the area faces- so it'd be a good move regardless of what fraction you move. 

* As a country, we're not very population dense- there is plenty of space. 

* The US is already hemorrhaging money, I'm sure politicians can find a little more.

The way I would do this is to offer people choices of various cities (with caps in place to a certain extent.). Then the government can assist in building housing to move the new refugees. Once people move in, they'd be given a certain amount of free stay (say a year.) and then be offered up a regular lease agreement based on the area's cost of living. As these empty they can be used as low cost housing for families. 

The cities that are chosen (specifically the areas of the cities that are expanded on) would be placed under a federal tax refund/break to people creating new business there (some tax experts would have to write up the conditions for this). Boosting the local economies and bringing jobs to the areas. The cities can also be given a boost to their education funds for a certain amount of time. This is where the city benefits.

The areas they were leaving would have less demand on their water reserves and could reevaluate how they are managing their resources. They'd be given more time to come up with long term solutions of their own instead of having to crunch down on it right now.

Edit: It's 7AM eastern time and I should probably try to go to bed. I'll respond further when I wake up.

Further Edits for clarity: 

Response to /u/Mckoijion RE: Costs

Additionally. 75 billion dollars is NOTHING in the scope of US government spending. The Federal government spent something like 3.6 trillion dollars for 2015. 75 billion comes out to about 2% of the annual federal budget. The federal government spends .4 trillion on welfare alone (this number does not include pensions or healthcare). I'm way to tired to track where that goes state-wise. 75 billion would represent 18% of the welfare budget. Some of that would really be more reallocated than removed. (Source on the Federal spending numbers)

For infrastructure, get cities to chip in. They would have a great potential to benefit from the new residents, jobs, businesses and services- not to mention since the tax break would be federal, they'd get new sources of income. They have to bite on the costs of infrastructure. Everyone would have some skin in the game- increasing everyone's drive to make it a successful system.",534,TRUE,,TRUE,1
303,CMV: I believe Reefer Madness is a thing.,FALSE,0,t3_3gbnvx,"Allow me to clarify. I firmly believe that for many individuals, marijuana allows psychological issues one might have to surface earlier and to manifest themselves at a higher intensity than if that individual abstained from smoking in the first place. Personally, I spent my early life with a mentally unstable parent who smoked heavily in high school and to the best of my knowledge has been going to therapy and heavily medicated since early adulthood. I've watched my sibling get into pot, get depressed, attempt suicide, and have anxiety attacks. This all started once they began smoking. I have dead friends, ""burn-out"" friends and friends who smoke 420 blaziken MLG pro Monster blunts daily with minor anxiety and side-effects. My point is that while pot doesn't directly give people depression or anxiety etc. that don't already have a propensity for it, that it does help bring those (forgive my lack of better phrasing) ""disorders"" to the surface. 

Ways to convince me: Reputable studies showing people who smoke are less likely to be depressed, anxious, suicidal. A fair-logical argument will likely win me over, since all my examples are generally first-hand.


Stuff that won't work- any argument saying ""you're only one person, this is a rare extreme"" ""have you ever smoked it?"" or ""Everything you said is objective etc. etc."" I'm not saying that those pursuits are incorrect, just that it's not going to convince me.


Thank you, and happy CMV'ing

1470,CMV: There is no good reason for the average person to ever buy a new car,TRUE,1,t3_35w8v2,"I'd like to preface this by saying I'm not a car guy, so it's entirely possible I'm overlooking something major, but given how fast cars depreciate in value, buying a new one seems like a really dumb move to me. Whatever features you are looking for in a car, you can get better features for the same or a lower price in a used car. Like, say you have $25,000 to spend on a car. You could get a nice new Toyota, or you could get a fully loaded Lexus that's less than a year old and has features that are superior in every measurable way to the new Toyota. Seems like a no-brainer to me which one I'd buy. So basically, aside from people for whom money is truly no object and I suppose people with pathological fears of sitting where others have sat, I just can't imagine any good reason for the average Joe with a limited budget and no debilitating phobias to buy a new car.

Most of the top 3D animation companies do make great movies.  But they are all kid themed.   Imagine if these companies could diverse their portfolios if they dealt with more adult themes.  Basically, the 3D companies could do what is done with Japanese animation.

This would great for the movie industry and they could use technology to do what you can't do with real actors.

For example, Pixar could have done a great Ghost in the Shell 3D reboot.

Some of Pixar's top movies are 'Toy Story,Up, Finding Nemo' which are comedic and some have child themes.

Anime in Japan as far as I can tell seems to have been very successful with exploring adult themes including topics such as science fiction, horror, crime dramas.  But the 3D animation companies that are American based only seem to focus on comedy or child themes.  It just seems that 3D animation and technology can create these amazing worlds, it is just unfortunate that the worlds are all targeted towards entertaining children.

In a world where we work in teams, as a community, in cities and in countries, the entire description of yourself is based on how other people view you, rather than how you view yourself. For example, no matter how funny you think you are, funniness is only determined by how funny OTHER people find you. You may be able to change how funny you are, but only by taking into account of what other people think is funny.

Furthermore, it is based on other people's decisions that get you to where you want to be. You can't sell a product without someone buying it. You can't get a job without someone hiring you. You do not exist until you are recognized to exist.

Please, change my mind on this. I'm having some really shitty thoughts, but can't help to get this mantra out of my mind.

426,"CMV: After an apocalypse, society would lack the natural resources needed to rebuild an industrialized society",FALSE,0,t3_3fbsv1,"There is a very interesting theory I've read about recently which discusses humanity's capacity to rebuild after an apocalypse and support any sort of industrialization a second time around.  A very in-depth discussion is available in this article 

http://aeon.co/magazine/technology/could-we-reboot-civilisation-without-fossil-fuels/

So, let's assume the world collapses, through some terrible tragedy.  For the sake of argument it doesn't really matter if it is nuclear war, or plague, a zombie outbreak, or whatever.  Let's simply assume that its devastating enough that 99% of humanity is gone, and society completely collapses.  Humanity has basically hit a reset button, and except for some ruins lying around the world, we are back in the stone age.  Eventually, we'll assume that society begins to rebuild.  First as small communities, and then eventually into larger and larger cities/states like we've seen in past human history.   

However, if we wanted to replicate our modern society, we simply wouldn't have the natural resources necessary to do so.  The basic theory is that due to our current use of fossil fuels, we've mined or extracted all the easily accessible fossil fuels that would be needed by an early industrializing society.  Almost all of the easily accessible coal, oil and other fuels are simply not available.  The remaining sources that are available require complex engineering that would likely not be available in early stages of industrialization.  And while renewable sources of energy, such as wind and water are available, they lack some of the benefits that fossil fuels bring.  The basic argument is that in order for a society to industrialize, it needs a source of relatively cheap, easily accessible energy, and that really only comes from fossil fuels in a pre-industrial society.  Renewable energy is really only feasible much further down the technology development curve.


For the sake of clarity, let's assume that reindustrialization is the goal.  Ultimately, we want to be able to colonize another planet.  I understand humanity could simply go back to living more in tune with nature, but for this discussion, lets assume that the goal is the longer term survival of the species by moving to another planet.

A good sniper has no real counter apart from another sniper, making them frustrating to play against. A majority of the other weapons have damage fall-off to discourage long-range play, further separating the sniper as a class. 

As far as I can tell, snipers mainly exist to pick off slow moving or high value targets, which the spy already does and does in a more interesting (to play as and against) way.

I can't see any way the sniper, sitting at the back of the map away from the action, adds to the game (as a side note, I also think the removal of sniper would do nothing but good for the class diversity on pubs).

1440,"CMV: If a killer asteroid were headed to Earth, Humans would be able to stop it.",TRUE,1,t3_363i1f,"I say ""killer asteroid"" in the title for brevity, but I mean any celestial object (asteroid, comet, planetoid, etc) large enough to wipe out life on Earth.

I have three basic reasons:

1. We know there are no planet-destroyers in the Asteroid Belt, which means anything that'd take out Earth would need to come from the Kuiper Belt or the Oort Cloud.  Both of these are very far away, and would give us lots of warning, even if the object were presently on its impact trajectory orbit.  More likely, we'd detect it multiple orbits in advance, and have decades or centuries before predicted impact.  But I think we'll at least have multiple years.

2. Nuclear weapons would be pretty effective at deflecting an object.  They are very energy dense, and [we can use a standoff detonation](http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/neo/report2007.html) to cause ablation on one side of the comet/asteroid and nudge it.  We only need a very slight nudge to push it off of an Earthbound trajectory when it is far away.

3. If an impact were imminent, humanity would throw all feasible resources into stopping it.  A lot of the things which make present space travel difficult would be overcome fast.  We would allow launches which have a high chance of spreading radioactive debris onto Earth for instance, or which have a high chance of loss of human life.  We might even send astronauts on a suicide mission.  Of course, money would be no object for this, and massive logistical resources would be poured into anything with a chance of saving us.

350,"CMV: I don't think I should try for any meaningful relationship, have children, or really try in life",FALSE,0,t3_3fyy9h,"My cat just died. He was a 2 and a half year old Bengal that got stricken with a sudden sickness, and just when the anti biotics seemed to be turning him around, he died.

I'm not intelligent, capable, good looking, or anything. I've never had a gf, don't really have friends anymore, and live a solitary life. But he was my only friend, he was the best cat who never bit or hissed at anyone, and was friendly and playful even with strangers. He was the only real good thing in my life, now my awesome PC and expensive headphones don't mean anything. 

This is pathetic, I know. It's not just him, it's just that now the sun of my life is gone the darkness that really is everywhere is more apparent.

The world is a sinking ship, everyone is scrambling for a high and dry spot. You all may have some super inspirational quote to give me, it makes the whole state of the ship seem less sorry, and maybe gotten us through when we go sprinkled with water (few in the first world know being near drowning in this analogy). Whatever existential philosophy there is wont justify how many people live lives where they do nothing but starve to death. The world isn't a story, everyone just crawls around like ants until we die. Even in less fanciful stories like ASOIAF at least there's a point, and there is some plot armor, but nothing's preventing a baby from being kidnapped later in life, eventually forgetting who she is year 16 in some strangers basement while having rape baby #6 punched out of her. 

Decay and negativity is the default state of everything. All things just erode away, everything is fated to end in destruction. It's ingrained into the universe and human brain. 

I was sheltered in the top deck of the ship, but now the ceiling of my room is leaking, and I'm reminded of the nature of everything. 

It's best I don't have any more attachments, no investments in a world so capricious and uncaring. 

Shit can still happen to me. But nothing so terrible as an abducted child, a career worked so hard for going down the tubes, getting cuckolded, or losing the best cat in the world when he was so young, can happen to me.

I should just find a stable job that'll get me enough to go on, a small cheap apartment that I'm not at risk of not being able to afford, and just stick to my vidya. Or I should kill myself. Anything to get out of/escape this fundamentally tainted reality. 


You can post your stories about how life once sucked for you but now you're happy as a clam. You just lucked out, doesn't mean life is actually worth it. Doesn't matter how touched you were when your kid was born, women are being circumcised right now and they were when your kid was being born. 


You can say I'll grow out of this thinking, you may be right, doesn't mean I'm wrong. People feel like this a lot at my age, but they don't grow out of it because of maturity like their belief in the Easter bunny. It's just because you got the job, mortgage, wife, and all these things binding you to the world. You can't bring yourself to admit how bullshit everything is when you have serious stake in it. Everything but what I'm saying is just a distraction in the end, so I should just retreat and turn into the skid, not giving life the chance to fuck me

1415,"CMV: I think that for someone like me with real &amp; consistent access to vegan options, every time I eat animal products, I'm doing something selfish &amp; morally wrong.",TRUE,1,t3_36bjzm,"I've been a vegetarian with no problem for 18 years now. 7 months ago, after reading [this AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2h8df0/i_am_an_80yearold_holocaust_survivor_who/) with Dr. Alex Hershaft, a Holocaust survivor and animal rights activist, I decided it was past time that I went vegan. I no longer believe there is available to me (presently, vat-grown stuff is looking pretty neat) such a thing as 'humane' eggs or dairy-- among other examples, egg-laying hen breeders kill roosters when they are still chicks and dairy cows are forcibly impregnated and their babies taken away from them. I understand that there's no way to completely avoid harming another creature, especially in our current industrial agriculture system, but I think it's my responsibility to reduce the harm I do as much as I can. I live in the U.S., have a good income, real &amp; consistent access to vegan alternatives, and have never experienced health problems from not eating animal products.

Yet, I'm still struggling. Even after I added a 'freegan' clause that I can eat animal products I am not paying for that would otherwise be thrown away (just as I can buy used leather shoes-- I'm not contributing to demand for the product), I often give in to temptation when, say, ice cream is on the table. I know veganism is not about being perfect, but still, I know better. And there's a lot of social pressure-- everyone seems to hate vegans, thinks we're self-righteous pains in the ass, up to and including my live-in boyfriend. 

I truly believe that contributing to the demand for exploitative animal products is wrong, deeply wrong and utterly fucked. And at the same time, I desperately (forgive the adverbs) want to give up veganism altogether and eat a plate of cheese fries from my favorite dive bar every other day. Change my view?

**Edit for clarity: I'm definitely rethinking some closely-held beliefs about whether you can produce eggs and milk without being cruel (thanks, Thoguth). That said, what I really, reallllly want to be convinced of is that it's cool to eat those cheese fries, for example.**

**Edit 2: Okay, it's been four hours and some of these replies are verging on 'rude or hostile' territory, and most having nothing to do with egg or dairy production anymore, much less industrially. I'm calling it a night, but thanks to everyone who was polite and kind and to those who gave me food for thought. I'll keep reading, and award more deltas when warranted.**

1515,CMV: Inheritance tax is ridiculous.,TRUE,1,t3_35hxd9,"I am not a ""tax is theft"" libertarian or even any kind of libertarian. If anything I learn more towards socialist, but I cannot get behind the idea of inheritance tax. Society and sound government requires taxes and I think it's absolutely fair to have taxes on income, sales, purchases, whatever. But for government to come in when a dying person passes on their belongings or money to someone they care about and snatch away a piece of it is a step too far.

I am currently living in Spain and was chatting to some Spanish people today. They mentioned that if you inherit a house you are required to pay a portion of the value as tax. However since Spain is in recession it is extremely difficult to sell the house, and some people are forced to forfeit the property in order to be aligned with the law. This is not the basis of my belief, but it is what motivated me to post this to CMV.

I want someone to give me a good reason to CMV since I think taxes are overall a positive thing. This is just one instance I think is outrageous.

**TL; DR** I understand the need for and support taxation but I cannot support government interference in a dying person's gift to another person. CMV!

EDIT: A few people are bringing up the situation in the US, where inheritance tax doesn't apply to amounts under 5 and a half million. That's fine. Well done USA. But just because it's adjusted and applied like that in the US doesn't make the concept any more agreeable when used throughout the rest of the world. I am not interested in talking about the US example if your argument is based around ""the US has this special set of circumstances and therefore the tax is ok"".

202,"CMV: Dr. Seuss should be required High School literature before ""classics"" such as Steinbeck, Dickens, and even Shakespeare",FALSE,0,t3_3h8slk,"My reasoning behind this is, for the most part the above authors lack lessons. While they don't all always, the biggest thing teachers enjoy is pointing out the themes behind each book. Why do themes matter? Why should students learn about literature in the past when we learn about the past from History?

Dr. Seuss's books contain lessons. Being yourself, being creative, not being an asshole, caring about the planet, etc.

I'm not picking out those authors exclusively, they're just some examples I thought of since I've read some of their works and I was disappointed (I guess you could say I had Great Expectations) because I'm in school to learn, and most of these books are rather dull and don't teach me anything besides themes that parallel from human nature back then to now. It's annoying reading Of Mice and Men and seeing all of these themes about friendship and loyalty in the great depression and not coming out a better person after reading it. You could stretch for several lessons but they're mostly reiterations of the themes. 

So I feel like the school system is failing me by dulling me down with pointless ""theme-based"" literature rather than literature with lessons and morals that could prepare us for the world we're gonna face. Not just themes in the world we can relate to, but how to not be a dick or how to plant a tree or stay creative while aging seem pretty important. 

So in order to not completely hate the school system and rant at my teacher and probably not do any homework based on the theme-based literature, CMV.

*For clarification, USA high schools. Not sure how other countries do their classes but our English classes have mandatory books read throughout the country. It's hard to find someone who hasn't read (or Sparknoted) Of Mice and Men, the Catcher in the Rye, Catch 22, and a bunch of Shakespeare stuff from middle/high school*

If you have been sentenced to death you do not deserve to die painlessly.,FALSE,0,t3_363uaq,"This argument does not have to do with innocent people being improperly sentenced to death, this is set in a hypothetical case where guilt was proven beyond a shadow of a doubt. 

I believe that if you have been sentenced to death that means your crime was so heinous that you are deemed irreparable, a permanent threat to society. Why should we show any concern with someone we are about to kill? The murderer (for example) did not show concern with the well being of their victim, so why should we do the same? Would it not benefit society if we could save money and use bullets or a rope every time?

383,CMV:The narrative for Black and Hispanic Americans struggles in this country are bogus based on the success of Poor Asian Immigrants.,TRUE,1,t3_3fqb1z,"This CMV has been done in some form before, but from an outside perspective looking in.  I am open to having my mind change or at least swayed, but this belief is rather ingrained.  

My wife and I are both children of Poor Asian immigrants to this country.  I will reflect on my mother’s story.  She had me very young out of wedlock with no support from my biological father while her parents were stuck in our native country.  When she came to this country she was on government assistance.  With very little support she was able to finish community college, transfer to a four year college majoring in computer science eventually getting a Master’s Degree.  Her story is not unique to the rest of my relatives or the Asian immigrant community.  I don’t need to discuss how my wife and I are doing since we have greatly benefited from our parent’s generation, their hard work and sacrifice.  

I hear the arguments regarding systemic discrimination of blacks in this country.  I’ve read Unequal Childhoods by Annette Laureau regarding kids in disadvantaged environments are less likely to succeed than those in middle to upper class upbringings.  However I don’t completely buy into it.  I’ve seen countless family members and friends go from food stamps to sedans in the burbs, and I attribute that to a culture centered around hard work, sacrifice, and education.  As my mom was going through school, we lived in poorer neighborhoods, and I was raised in neighborhoods with Blacks and Hispanics, sure I’ll throw out the I had black friends card, I still do.   At the time we were on the same level economically, yet culturally we were worlds apart in what was emphasized from a parenting standpoint.  As I grew up I met more successful black kids in undergrad, grad school, work, but most of them came up from middle class upbringings.  They had no problems acting 'white' while I saw my childhood poor black friends get mocked for doing so, therefore I believe its a cultural part of poor black americans which is hindering them from assimilating into middle class america.  That is why I don’t have compassion for the narrative that is pushed in the media for the poor black or hispanic american unable to rise from poverty.  I know this is a strong talking point for the right wing yet I have not read any tangible counter argument to the dispute the Poor Asian immigrant story.  If there are books or articles which provides a cogent counter argument please feel free to share.    

TL:DR – The rationale for why blacks and Hispanics are unsuccessful in the U.S. are bunk because of the success of Asian Immigrants.  

Edit: This is not to say that there isn't racism in society, especially towards Asians.  Colleges definitely try to make it harder for Asians to get admitted despite higher scores, and there is a Bamboo Ceiling in the workplace.  However, I don't believe racism is so pervasive in this country that it can hold an entire demographic in poverty against their will, I believe this is attributed to culture.  

Edit2: I appreciate the dialogue.  One point which I'll concede and am swayed from the dialogue is that racism, more specifically the historic racism perpetrated in the U.S. such as Jim Crow and Slavery created the culture which is present in the poor black community, hindering them from rising from poverty.  But nothing disputes that this culture is reason, and not the present-day racism that is preventing them from achieving in this country.  That is what I have issue against that the media portrays a image of victimization due to current day racism, however, I don't think the type of racism is the cause, maybe past racism, but not the type minorities face today.  If no one has a counter argument against the cultural aspect, shouldn't black culture, the one that glamorizes the baller lifestyle, be the focused of policy makers to change rather than focusing their efforts on social restructuring to accomodate the culture?  

Edit3: At the end of the day, and the dialogue set forth I come away from it with the following:

1) That current poor black culture  is a result of systemic discrimination.  
2) No one has disputed that culture which I have generally claimed is the REASON for the state of poor black americans.  
3) The present day racism and white privilege that exists today is not sufficient enough to either hold a demographic down or lift them up, not as much as the modern day media seem to claim.   
4) I want to beef up on some books and articles cited
5) The IQ debate. hmmm I'm just not going to touch that right now.

My point is that if some undesirable outcome is a logical consequence of some action or ideology, then people who don't want that outcome, will try to figure out how to do that action or fallow that ideology without causing that outcome. I think that people and societies in general are smart enough and/or reasonable enough to know when it would be bad to fallow something to a logical conclusion and so they will stop before they get there. If that makes them a hypocrite, then so be it. I'm perfectly fine with people being hypocrites if it keeps them from doing something unfavorable. So tell me, am I wrong to see things this way?

310,"CMV: Liberalism is currently undergoing a schism, and is splitting into two factions",TRUE,1,t3_3ga6xh,"From what I have observed, liberals tend to fall into one of two categories, both of which are vehemently opposed to the other.

The first faction is heavily focused on political correctness and the “social justice” movement. They are major proponents of multiculturalism. They tend to view human social behavior as being socially constructed, and the result of the environment, and are often hostile towards evolutionary psychology. They are more focused on equality of outcome than equality of opportunity. Mainstream feminists fall into this category. They are also more likely to support gun control than the second faction. They have more female members compared to the second faction, and are more likely to be religious.
Examples of liberals in this faction include: Hillary Clinton, Laci Green, Mike Rugnetta, Trace Dominguez, PZ Myers, and Jen McCreight.

The second faction is liberal socially and economically, i.e. on abortion, gay marriage, drug liberalization, health care, etc., but is vehemently against the political correctness that the first faction espouses. They are also more averse to multiculturalism than the first faction. They tend to seek biological explanations for human behavior, and are more accepting of evolutionary psychology. They are more focused on equality of opportunity than equality of outcome. Almost all of the members of this faction are atheists. This faction is much more heavily male dominated than the first faction. They are also more likely to support gun rights compared to members of the first faction.

So please tell me how can GMOs be bad when they are able to be grown in harsh soil and climates, resist disease and bugs, consume less water (in light of the Californian drought this seems especially important), and in some cases contain more nutrients?

1420,CMV:There are only three genders,TRUE,1,t3_36ansk,"Okay, so this is something I see very often and sparks arguments fast. I've heard a lot about this ""sex and gender are not the same"", but that is not agreed on by all. Actually, if I have understood correctly (from Wikipedia, but ofc it might be wrong) the view is mostly held by those who study womens' studies/gender studies, and not even all of those. Sex and gender are used interchangeably in common speech in English, and do not have separate words in my native tongue.

I do not mean to say that there are no such thing as trans people. But trans people are not their own gender. A woman who identifies as a man is a man and not a FtM-gibberishgender. At least I haven't met any transgender people who want to identify as something else than male, female or intersex. If someone is physically female and identifies as toothpaste, I do not know if that is a gender. 

The three genders then would be male, meaning either strictly those with a penis, or anyone who identifies as a male, female, meaning either everyone with a vagina or anyone who identifies as a female, and intersex, either strictly meaning anyone who is not cis male or cis female, or anyone who does not associate themselves with the two other genders.

I am myself in favour of the less strict versions.

I personally think that if you're going kill an animal, it's inherently disrespectful to the animal (unless you're putting it out of misery like it's been hurt badly and is suffering). Even if an animal is killed painlessly, it's still obviously in their interests to not die. In fact just about every action and impulse an animal has is from the interest of survival.

547,CMV: Your race should have no effect on your chances of getting into a good university.,TRUE,1,t3_3ekjn3,"I just read this [article](http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-adv-asian-race-tutoring-20150222-story.html#page=1) stating that blacks and hispanics have an easier time getting into certain colleges than asians and whites. This just seems idiotic to me. Especially considering that only certain minorities have an easier time getting in, while others like asians have a much harder time. It should be based on your grade average and the score you get on your SAT (I'm from Canada so I'm not really sure how SAT score factors into that. I'm used to only your high school grades being counted). If an asian student gets a 90% average, his/her application shouldn't be tossed aside for a black student who only managed to get an 83% average. Maybe in the past affirmative action was necessary, due to racial bias. Nowadays it's completely useless and does nothing but inhibit asians and whites.

I believe your race shouldn't matter when it comes to these things. It's like saying blacks and hispanics are more stupid than asians and whites and therefore should get some help to get into college. Also, before you say that it has to do with economic status, I would like to disagree. My family (including cousins and whatnot) came from very poor circumstances. However, most of my cousins have gone on to get degrees in things like engineering. If you don't do good in school, it's either because your capacity to learn in that certain subject or in general is lower than other people (say being bad at math or English) or you just didn't try hard enough.

Alright, so, i was challenged by a friend of mine to post this here for discussion, and while i am open to ideas to modify it or drop it entirely, i will only do so if you can actually change my mind. I will not give up easily.
I believe I can change this country, better yet, this world for the better. The whole idea behind what I am about to say relates back to evolution. Humans do not allow evolution to take place properly. We save the weak. I personally believe that we should execute the weak. yes, this sounds harsh but let me explain why. We are not advancing as a race. For now though, we will keep it to America for the sake of the argument and hope the rest of the world catches on. Another massive problem we are facing is over population, we are using our resources and producing waste and pollution and mind blowing rates.
You look at animals and if an animal doesn't want to eat, it dies, if a human doesn't want to eat, it has an eating disorder and is treated for the disorder. More importantly that human is allowed to procreate. We allow shitty genetics to be passed on. We SAVE the WEAK. We also allow these morbidly obese, incredibly stupid people live and breed. If an animal in the wild isn't fit, or cannot attract a mate, it will die and or be unable to pass on its genetics. Humans may be fat and physically repulsive but if they have money they can still get women and still have children, which fucks with the gene pool. I could go on for longer in this section but if more reasoning is necessary i'll continue on later.
Now to determine who is to be executed. The type of people i want to execute are people who are not able to make a contribution to society. If you weigh 500 pounds but you're incredibly smart, you can still make a contribution to society. The opposite is also true, if you're borderline retarded but you're very physically fit, you can also contribute to society. People who are mentally unstable shall also be executed as we wouldn't want their genetics passed on and they are a threat to the gene pool we are creating.
What will determine who is executed: At the age of 14 years old, annual testing will begin based on birthday. There will be three tests, a mental test, a physical test, and a psychological test. Your Mental test exactly 3 months after your birthday and your physical test 9 months after your birthday. Tests will vary depending on your age, the older you get the harder they become, until the age of 20 where they will remain the same until 35 and gradually work their way down until the age of 65 where no further testing will be required. At the age of 20 we will also introduce psychological testing which will continue until the age of 65.
What the tests will consist of: The mental test will be a basic evaluation of your ability to do math, your ability to read and write, and your basic understanding of the sciences. This test should not be difficult, anyone who has at least a D average in school should be just fine. For the physical test, every age group will be required to complete a mile in 16 minutes. This is a very easy time to make, you can walk that pace. Physical tests will include varying push up or sit up tests depending on age group. There may be a few other exercises required in certain age groups, and the amount of repetitions will also vary depending on age. this should be easy for anyone who isn't morbidly obese. Next is the psychological test. These will be administered every 5 years to insure mental stability and health of everyone. We want the mental health of our gene pool to be good as well. Lastly, there will be certain ways to be omitted to testing, ALL WILL BE FROM SOME SORT OF SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION TO SOCIETY, the main one being in the military. If you served in the military without being dishonorably discharged, you will be exempt from any further testing in your lifetime. Another example of a way to be omitted from testing is by paying for it. The cost will be $25,000 per year, per person. Many will be angry that it's giving more power to the rich, but i see it as a valid way of determining someones potential for making a contribution to society. If you are rich, I will almost guarantee you are either physically fit enough or mentally fit enough to pass the tests and you would have been fine anyway. AN IMPORTANT NOTE: You will only have to pass 2 out of 3 tests.
How we will execute people: We will set up an organization in charge of carrying out testing and executing people. My idea is to possibly have the military be in charge of this, though I haven't had the time to think too much into that, this I am very open to other ideas on. The method of execution i think will be best is the firing squad. 8 men, 2 with real bullets to ensure death, 6 with blanks for the obvious reason. For those who are unaware, my understanding is that firing squads use primarily blanks so the gunmen aren't aware of who actually killed the person so they don't have trouble with living life after killing someone.
Now another thing i would like to do that isn't executing people, but will improve our gene pool is preventing certain people from having children. People with MORE THAN two generations of diagnosed cancer or potentially terminal illnesses that tend to be passed on genetically will be sterilized. These people will not be allowed to produce offspring, however we will make it easy for them to adopt if they would like to have children.
I would also like to place a limit on the amount of children a person may have. The maximum number of children a person may have is 3, which is a very reasonable amount. It should slow the rate of population increase or possibly make the population decrease due to some couples not having children or only having 1 child. There is no reason to have more than 3 children because at that point you're just putting a burden on society. If say you already have 2 children and you would like to have a third but you end up with twins, triplets, or even more, you will be allowed to keep them as it wasn't your intent to have that many. When you hit the limit for children you will be sterilized.
This is all i can think of for now, if i remember more of my plan i will post. So reddit users, change my view.",8,FALSE,,FALSE,0
596,CMV: The public reaction to the Ashley Madison hacks are way out of line,FALSE,0,t3_3e769l,"We don't know the situations of any of the people using this website. There is more than one configuration that can make for a stable marriage or LTR. What if you have a non-monogamous partner that consents to your extramarital activities, but you still felt the necessity to be discreet due to societal pressures? Or maybe your partner is unable to meet certain needs but still loves and wants you to find that satisfaction elsewhere? Or maybe, due to circumstance, you are temporarily stuck in an unhappy marriage but still have this crazy feeling that despite whatever mistakes you made to get into this situation, you are a human being and deserve to find happiness? There are really so many possibilities and to say that all of the people wronged met the end they deserved is to [deny rational thinking so that it aligns nicely with our view of how the world should be](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-world_hypothesis).

I've never seen this website myself so I really can't say anything about the demographics of its userbase, but imagine being in a situation like this and having your private information stolen from you, seriously endangering your social and professional life (and that of your spouse's) while strangers on the internet as well as peers in real life jeer at you and call you scum and filth who deserved it in the first place.

There are plenty of assholes who cheat on their spouses. There are also plenty of assholes who don't. But to try to make any kind of sweeping moralistic judgment about some group of 37 million strangers is unjustly harmful and heavily biased in nature.

241,"CMV: While white people will never be able to understand what it means to be a minority, that doesn't mean we cannot be critical of their actions.",TRUE,1,t3_3gvhnz,"I recently got in an argument with a friend regarding the BLM (Black Lives Matter) interruption of Bernie Sanders speech. I argued that while I understand their frustration, I still hold its unacceptable to break the law the way BLM did. 

My friend argued back that since both of us are white, we can never understand the situation and the anger these representatives of BLM feel. Therefore, she argued, we cannot criticize their actions since we cannot and can never understand their perspective.

My friend showed me [this article](http://time.com/3605606/ferguson-in-defense-of-rioting/) in defense of her argument. I'll quote from the conclusion,

&gt;Instead of tearing down other human beings who are acting upon decades of pent-up anger at a system decidedly against them, a system that has told them they are less than human for years, we ought to be reaching out to help them regain the humanity they lost, not when a few set fire to the buildings in Ferguson, but when they were born the wrong color in the post-racial America.

In response to the article, I essentially argued that while I do feel for minorities in the U.S, violence is neither a morally sound or pragmatic way to go about change. I also felt that the argument presented (we are not minorities, therefore we will never be able to understand, therefore we cannot criticize) is fundamentally unsound.

I'd love to hear some support for her viewpoint, because I am an open-minded person and I care about racial equality America

So please, CMV!

490,CMV:The USA is the least trustworthy nation to possess atomic weapons,TRUE,1,t3_3ewjnh,"I have come to this conclusion for several reasons.
*The USA is the only nation in the history of humanity to actually use atomic weapons against an enemy. From past experience alone it is the country most likely to use them again.

*The main positive effect of atomic weapons, that gets brought up a lot , is mutually assured destruction. The USA dropped 2 atomic bombs, not as retribution to an atomic attack. It demonstrated a lower bar for considering using them.

*The USA regularly starts new wars. It's certainly the nation among the big superpowers that is most likely to initiate a new war and, in the case of Irak, can not even explain why they went to war in the first place. A country that is this likely to be involved in wars is more likely to find itself in a position where it would consider using another atomic bomb.

1238,CMV: Nonwhite people should be grateful for the accomplishments that whites have made. African Americans should be thankful that they do not still live in Africa and nonwhite countries should view colonialism in a positive light.,TRUE,1,t3_3856c4,"In spite of the imperfections of the USA and Europe, it still remains a truth that pretty much all of the most desirable places in the world are run by Caucasian Westerners. The quality of life for all people, even nonwhites, is generally correlated with the percent of white Westerners in leadership; Black Canadians have better lives than black Americans who have better lives than Jamaicans who have better lives than Congolese. This is true on a global scale; lily-white cities and countries generally report the best quality of life and highest GDP per capita. [The most developed countries in the world are almost all white-run or dependent on white-run countries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Human_Development_Index); even Japan is dependent on white Westerners for trade, military, disaster relief, and [entertainment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hāfu), and in spite of attempting to [Charles Atlas](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower) its way to development with superhuman feats of education and work ethic, Japan's GDP per capita still lags that of France. South Korea is the same way, with an even more endemic academic cheating culture.

1245,"CMV: Preventing sexually promiscuous adolescent children from engaging in sexual behaviour with other children (or adults, if they choose) is a violation of a child's rights to bodily integrity.",FALSE,0,t3_382olr,"My view is based on the acceptance that a free expression of bodily integrity includes the ability to chose not only what is done to a persons body, but also, what to do with it. 

Before commenting, please understand this isn't an argument for allowing children to have sex with adults. It may simply be the case that society accepts that infringing upon a child's right to bodily integrity is a reasonable thing to do, since it is generally considered unacceptable for children to be engaging in sexual behaviour. 

Also, just to point out that when I talk about children engaging in sexual behaviour with adults, I am saying this knowing fully well that children cannot **legally** consent to sex. That isn't to say that children cannot consent, just that the consent isn't considered to be consent in law. A child can consent to anything with regards to their bodily integrity but there is quite rightly a standard in law which protects children against certain things. 

Furthermore, in a situation where a child instigates or freely consents to sexual activity instigated by another person it can be said that a child's bodily integrity is violated by any law which prevents them from engaging in that behaviour. In a situation where the behaviour in question is instigated by another person and the child does not freely consent then it would obviously be a violation of their bodily integrity TO engage in the behaviour in question, so by virtue of the nature of bodily integrity, this situation only applies when the child really is willing. 

Edit: added definition of bodily integrity

1199,CMV:Reddit-style forums are superior to the more common single thread forums for almost any purpose.,TRUE,1,t3_38kv3z,"To pull an example of a single thread forum off the web: [here](http://support.zathyus.com/index/).

The only situation where single threads might be good is where a fixed group is involved, for example project planning by a small team or a roleplaying session with a game master.  In that case, it might be good to prevent the conversation from fracturing and keep everyone on the same page.

When it comes to most social or entertainment purposes, reddit's style of branching threads with up/downvotes just works better.

-It prevents the loudest people in the conversation from drowning everyone out.  In addition, it allows you to ignore particularly obnoxious posters.

-It allows discussion of a tangent without derailing the main topic.

-It allows you to go back to earlier posts in the conversation and address points that were overlooked the first time around.

-Upvotes give you a way to silently voice approval, without wasting words to repeat what the other poster said.

-Reddit's AMA tradition is one of the better ways of conducting public interviews, and it would not be possible in a single thread forum.

With all these advantages, I don't think that single thread forums should be used as much as they are.

205,CMV: I believe exiling people is a way better alternative than jail,FALSE,0,t3_3h88yb,"Coming from a country that used to do this a lot (Venezuela), I believe that it would be way better than using jailtime.

A regular prisioner costs around 30 000 USD per year, and by exiling them out of the country not only do you save all that money, you also get rid of the part of the population that was breaking the law, the part you want to get rid off.

In the end I just believe that getting rid of criminals by exiling them rather than placing them in jail is cheaper, and better overall for the country. 

EDIT: -By exile I refer to ""banning"" them to the country, as if in, you cannot re-enter this country by any means.
         
         -For the many People asking about which countries would accept them consider this example: USA has a       several-times drug offender who could get 55 years of jail (1.6M USD) or be exiled to Uruguay. Uruguay can get this educated american and could benfit from having a better working and promote american immigration (This has happened before with Venezuela and Europe and it led to the best decade ever for the country), also many less competent countries promote more competent countries' immigration, which doesn't happen often, besides these countries also are often more open to many crimes that more competent nations are not      

        -This is coming way too often, if you are skeptical of the fact that there are unfair, life long, jail sentences, here read [this] (http://famm.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Chart-All-Fed-MMs-NW.pdf) if TL;DR 1000 plants of cannabis, 1g of LSD, or 50g of meth can get you life sentence

 -This is in light of United States condemming Venezuela's Presidents decision to exile Leopoldo Lopez
         
-This post is reuploaded! thanks for the comments and keep them coming
        
- I'm not suggesting exiling serial killers or others of the sort, just for minor offences  (marijuana, prostitution, ect) sending them to places where this is legal and give them the option for jail or exile

1024,CMV: I feel like the Republicans are the 'bad guys' PLEASE CMV!,FALSE,0,t3_3ac4qi,"I've drunk the koolaide. I'm becoming a biased partisan hack. I believe that one of the biggest problems with this country is the deep, seemingly irreconcilable animosity between the followers of the two parties, and I am part of that problem. 



Yet as much as I try, I cannot bring myself to view the Republicans as anything but a regressive influence on the USA. On some deep level, I've accepted the stereotype that Republican voters are bible thumping, gun wielding, blindly patriotic semi-racists. I'm not talking so much about the elected officials but rather the voters. I feel that, from what I can gather through the 'liberal' media and my personal experience, Republican opinions are largely formed (at least more so than Democrats) on ignorance, xenophobia, religion, guns, and hatred for Obama. I know such a broad and negative stereotype can't really be true, but I still can't shake it. I don't pretend to understand much about economics so most of my feelings come from my revulsion with the party's stance on social issues. 



Here are a few bits of my limited understanding of the party's platform:



Social Issues: 

- Opposing gay marriage: I have tried to find a credible argument against gay marriage, but have repeatedly failed. Currently, their argument before the supreme court rests on gays being unfit to raise children/procreate and the floodgates opening for polygamy etc.  

- Downplaying racial/gender discrimination as out of control political correctness: This seems like mostly suburban/rural white men being unable to empathize with groups of people they've never/rarely met. And some genuine racism.

- Defensiveness over religion/guns: The gun debate is too muddied for me to have a strong opinion on, but I feel Republicans' fears over attacks on Christianity are largely unfounded and that, if anything, Christianity has too large an influence on our culture/government.

- Immigration: I don't understand the positives/negatives of different approaches to immigration, but the Republican voter's opposition seems to come from xenophobia and trumped up fear about terrorists/freeloaders sneaking in.



Security Issues:

- Support for aggressive policing and invasive homeland security: I realize Rand and Co have been at the forefront of action against the NSA, but my personal experience has left me believing that most Republican voters are for strengthening national security and increasing military spending. I also feel that the strongest voices to come out in support of the recent police-on-black violence were conservatives.

- Hawkish foreign policy: I feel that Republicans have an emotional and aggressive reaction to Russia, Iran, Syria, ISIS and would be more willing to intervene militarily without regard to whether or not such intervention would be beneficial. They seem willing to pursue cathartic violence and disinclined to examined our militaries checkered past.



Economic Issues:

- Welfare Queens: Again, I really don't understand enough about economics to judge a good policy from a bad one, but I see the Republicans as using the idea of welfare queens to scare up opposition to social programs and further stigmatize the poor. They view Obamacare/Goverment assistance as handouts given to the undeserving.

- Blame the poor: It feels like Republicans push the idea that, without regulations, people will be able to pull themselves out of poverty and that the only thing keeping them down is either the government or their own laziness.



Environmental Issues:

- Global warming skepticism: This seems motivated by the party's ties to fossil fuel, fear of change, hatred for anything Obama, and anti-intellectual disdain for 'nancy-pansy' green stuff.





TL:DR - I feel like the Republican voting base is motivated primarily by religion, xenophobia, fear of change, hatred for Obama. Their positions are ignorant, contradict available evidence, short sighted, and selfish. 





What would change my mind?

-Evidence of a largely liberal leaning media/culture that suppresses honest Republican voices and prevents me from seeing the other side of the picture.

-Evidence that Republican news media (Fox, Breibart, Drudge, Talk Radio, etc) are reputable and not fear mongering propaganda barkers. 

-Strong arguments supporting the Republican platform and evidence that Republican voters share these views.

-Surprise me!

863,"CMV: It's immoral to spend any more money than what you must spend for basic needs and reasonable comfort, when that money could be used to help people in need.",TRUE,1,t3_3bsou9,"**GONNA START OFF RIGHT NOW BY SAYING I DON'T LIVE BY THIS RULE.**

Reasons being:

1. I am 16 and (obviously) live with my family still, I don't have a job or any personal income to speak of. I don't have the financial independence to live by this creed.

2. It sounds like not much fun

One of those reasons is pretty valid and one definitely isn't.

I believe this because it just makes the most logical sense to me. Why on earth would it be fair for me to walk around with a new pair of shoes when there's people I can see *in my own damn neighborhood* who can't afford a square meal, to speak nothing of comfortable clothing? It's just...wrong.

That's why I think that as soon as somebody has their basic needs and some *reasonable, modest* comforts like a TV, and air conditioning, any more money past that should go to a charity, or similarly be used for good.

**I'm really, really not trying to be high and mighty about this**. I don't live like this, and honestly even when I move out and start making my own money I don't think I'd be able to bring myself to throw out the PC and the cellphone and the car. I also don't think there's any non-arbitrary specific point where it could be declared that someone is being selfish with their money, and also everybody's definition of ""basic needs and modest comforts"" is probably different. I think you still get my meaning.

I still believe, speaking in idealistic terms, it's unjustifiable to keep to yourself what would be best spent saving others.

**EDIT:** My V has been C'd! /u/Lesser_Frigate_Bird made a good comment please read it. Keep the responses coming if you want though!

**EDIT2:** A couple of challenges have been along the lines of, ""where do you draw the line on what's a basic need and what's frivolous spending?"" to which I'd have to respond, ""I don't know but I think you catch my drift"". Obviously if we were going to codify this belief into law there would need to be a strict number or strict criteria but on an individual basis, even though it'd be different from person to person, I think everybody knows roughly what's a reasonable need or desire and what's too much.

Apple can ban whatever they want as a private entity. However, I believe they have made a huge mistake in banning apps that contained confederate imagery. The confederate flag was not the essence of the apps as far as I have seen. They actually **were** historical. While I believe the confederate flag to be rotten, I do not think it should be censored. I believe that when one considers whether or not to ban something, a symbol advocating an idea should be considered distinct from expression or documentation of that idea.  

I believe that this banning is a bad business decision. Not only are they losing the money for the apps themselves but they are alienating a demographic that supports the flag, and a demographic that do not support the flag but support free speech. 

I believe this is bad for humanity because the backlash against this banning will turn the confederate flag into a symbol for free-speech, which will muddy up the issue of racial tension even more.  More importantly, I fear that it will set a precedent for large companies that provide information and access to culture to ban essential historical information. 

-TL;DR :  **Context Matters!!**  and Apple's execution of the censorship was harmful on many levels.

275,CMV: Minimum wage jobs should not be viewed as strictly jobs for teenagers or unskilled workers and instead should be viewed as legitimate careers,FALSE,0,t3_3gibvx,"Edit: I feel it's necessary to define a few terms in the context that I'm using them for clarity.

* job - Any position where both employer and employee know, or should know, that the position is long-term temporary at best and that at some point the employee will move on.   
* career - your chosen life's work.  If you work fast food your whole life, that is your career
* minimum wage job - Any job, usually in the service industry, that generally requires little to no formal education, and generally pays between the federal minimum wage up to and including $15.00/hr.  
_______________________________________________________________________________________

Minimum wage is a hot topic of debate these days, and I'm sure a lot of visitors to this sub are tired of talking about raising, lowering, or eliminating the minimum wage but that isn't what this is about.  I did a search and couldn't find anything else that was similar to my stance so I'm hoping it will foster some new discussions.

During every debate concerning minimum wage someone will always say something to the effect that ""minimum wage jobs aren't meant to support a family/are meant for teenagers and unskilled workers"" and I think that this line of thinking is just outright wrong.  

Throughout the past 50 years, people took minimum wage service industry jobs when they were young/inexperienced in order to gain the experience that was required in order to land a production career.  That was the viewpoint, you got a minimum wage ""job"" in order to get the experience to start a ""career"" in the production world (whether directly producing something, or supporting those who do ie office staff, vendors, logistics, etc.).  

Also over that time, the economy in the US has gone from production based to service based.  This has caused a severe drop in production ""careers"" leaving nothing but the service industry left.  The service industry is now the career simply due to lack of other options.

 I joined the military when I was 20 years old because after working in the service industry at minimum wage for 5 years I finally landed a production job on an assembly line (this was in 1998). The money was better than anything I'd made previously, but not good enough to get ahead.  I ended up getting my girlfriend at the time pregnant and I saw the future that my current position offered and I wanted more so I enlisted. I spent 10 years working as an Aviation Electronics Technician before getting out to accept a position as a Federal Law Enforcement Officer with the US Forest Service. I worked at that position for 5 years before losing my job through no fault of my own. So there I was, a very highly skilled electronics tech, with 5 years of law enforcement experience, living in an area where 80% of the available jobs are minimum wage service industry and I needed a job. I applied everywhere....I mean everywhere. I filled out applications for Taco Bell, McDonald's, Walmart, etc. I got exactly 4 callbacks and 2 interviews during my job search where I was filling out 5-10 job applications per week...for 3 years before giving up. I couldn't get hired...why? Because for 15 years I made between $28-75k/year and every employer knows that there is no way I can support my family on minimum wage...and why would they pay me more when they can just pay someone else the minimum. I have been effectively unemployable in my current location since 2011 due in large part to the fact that everyone (including employers) knows minimum wage doesn't pay enough to support a single person, much less a family of six.

I think the mentality that ""minimum wage jobs aren't careers and shouldn't pay enough to support a family"" is more destructive than it is beneficial.  

TL;DR: Minimum wage jobs are no longer the sole realm of teenagers and the unskilled because the US doesn't produce anything anymore so those are the only careers available to most people.

From what I see, he's a down to earth guy who wants equality, who wants huge cooperation to actually pay taxes and wants minimum wage to be able to keep people alive. He wants basic healthcare and education and humane living conditions for everyone. He seems like a saint!

1156,"CMV: We should be wary of ""Save the Boobies"" and similar breast preservation focused cancer awareness campaigns.",FALSE,0,t3_395m6c,"I have a cousin and now a grandmother affected by breast cancer.  The former has had it for the better part of a decade now and has become very active in a number of breast cancer awareness campaigns.  I've become a little more active here to be supportive.

I understand the positive motivations behind phrasings like ""Save the Boobies"" or ""Save the Ta-Tas.""  I get that they're a more lighthearted approach to breast cancer awareness and survival, and that they draw in (presumably, or at least arguably) more crowds than their serious counterparts, and that not everything surrounding breast cancer has to be sober or grim.  I don't begrudge people for gravitating towards this approach.

My CMV basically revolves around the fact that I'm concerned this marginalizes women who either proactively got a mastectomy or did so precisely because they absolutely needed to to survive. I think these people have a strong claim to awareness and survival and that the focus of these campaigns should be those two characteristics and not making sure women keep their breasts.  This is understandably important to many women, and I appreciate that, but I am uncomfortable with the notion that keeping breasts is a galvanizing feature for broad swaths of people and that we might be unintentionally excluding/marginalizing a core set of survivors.

A few things that keep me from swinging entirely in this direction:

- I could be completely off-base and maybe most survivors, including those who have had their breasts removed, are okay with this framing of awareness.  I defer to people who have gone through this experience more than me as a casual observer.

- Women presumably want to keep their breasts and there's nothing wrong with that as an aspirational goal that can be part of the survival package.  I don't want to paint the picture that I think this desire is wrong or superficial.

- If it was demonstrated that this kind of marketing has generated so much participation, awareness, and fundraising that its practical effects off-set any implication that we, as a society, are preoccupied with women keeping breasts rather than beating cancer.

CMV, please.

1081,CMV: Economic Refugees should be deported immediately.,FALSE,0,t3_39ubv5,"Europe has a hard time dealing with refugees from all over africa.
Because of a variety of reasons. From persecution because of race, gender, sexual orientation or religion. Because of war or because of famine. This are all valid reasons to seek refuge.

But many people enter europe to have a better life here. To work here because we are rich.
I think those ""refugees"" should be send back immediately. Because they have no right whatsoever to stay here. They dont have to fear imminent risk of life or property and currupt the economic system of the EU through illegal emplyment.

And they make it harder for those who have real reasons to enter to get access into the Union.

Instead of fleeing they could risk their lifes in a more meaningfull way and change their respective countries to offer a more prosper future. Because risking their lifes is what they do anyway.

685,CMV: Makeup is bad.,TRUE,1,t3_3dbzzt,"I've been thinking about this a lot lately, and I can't think of anything redeeming about makeup. 

1) It takes forever to put on. I feel like this is most of the reason women are given a reputation for taking ages to ready themselves, and given that I think it's unnecessary, it's actually a waste of time no matter how long it takes.

2) It's harmful. Not only physically, where it may causes skin problems, headaches, premature aging, cancer, allergies, other skin diseases, and other things, but it can be harmful to the self-image of the woman wearing makeup, making them dependent upon the makeup, feeling ugly without it, etc.

3) It's disingenuous. I think of it as false advertising. Celebrities are a big indication of this to me, many of them don't look particularly nice without makeup on, and with regular women the drop in attractiveness without makeup is generally even more noticeable.

This is all that comes to mind at the moment.

62,CMV: Americans of all races should actively refrain form using the N-word with the hope that it fades from use entirely over time.,FALSE,0,t3_3ikcnu,"The N-word - no other word in the English language has such a powerfully negative meaning or evokes such a visceral reaction from both blacks and whites alike. 

It seems African Americans in the U.S. attempt to ""own it"" or ""redefine it in a positive way"", as some kind of symbol of brotherhood - at least within their own community.  This seems to me as ridiculous as Jews trying to re-appropriate the Swastika as a positive icon in their community. However, by continuing to use the word, they merely keep the term in use in modern language and create awkward circumstances for other races for whom it's not socially acceptable to be used in even the most positive contexts.

There are plenty of derogatory terms throughout history that have faded from use and are no longer relevant and I think given the inflammatory nature of the word, as well as the shameful history it represents, it should be actively avoided - even in ""positive"" contexts which only serve to perpetuate its use.

Lastly, how would language truly suffer by the removal of this particularly nasty word?  Language evolves and adapts over time, and if the majority of people both black and white actively discourage its use, eventually it will die out - and the English language will be better for it.

There are several points here and I'm sure some I have missed from the central argument so feel to flesh out the situation a bit more in your argument.

I don't believe you can make a rock solid case for being veggie, unless you refer to climate change, and once you look at that I think the case for being vegan is unanswerable, I still have regrets that I'm not vegan, although not major ones, as otherwise I'd not eat pizza quite so much.

That said I do think there is also an ethical argument against harming animals who can feel pain and have a capacity to suffer. I certainly think this is the case with most medium to large size mammals like cats, dogs, pigs, chickens, dolphins and whatnot. For that reason I wouldn't eat those animals even if it was sustainable to do so, unless I was sure they had been reared and killed humanely.

When it comes to animals who are clearly less conscious I don't feel the same way. I don't have any qualms about swatting flies, and I also recognise the need for pest control. I wouldn't have any problem with lethal rat traps being used in a restaurant (although obviously that should go hand in hand with taking measures to discourage them being in the kitchen in the first place like not leaving food out overnight).

I don't know if fish can experience pain or not. I don't know if they can suffer like other higher mammals can. 

As I don't know for sure, I'm reluctant to join in with the fishing that'll take place when we go and stay with my partners family at a cottage near a river which allows for excellent fishing. 

I quite like the idea of fly fishing, I feels it's pretty sustainable (I might be wrong), and also that fish probably don't have the mental capacity to suffer (I might be wrong again). I'd rather avoid doing something I'll learn that I shouldn't have done in 20 years though than take the risk.

693,CMV: Iran will not attemp to build a nuclear weapon in the near future because the imputus for a nuclear deterrent - a threatened attack by the US - no longer exists.,FALSE,0,t3_3dbdvo,"Back in the early 2000's, Iran had a good reason to want a nuclear weapon. They had been named as one of the three members of the ""Axis of Evil"" by president Bush. One of the other members was invaded and occupied by the US, leaving a massive military presence directly next door. Top level Republicans openly discussed the possibility of invading Iran. The President publicly refused to rule out the use of nuclear weapons in a war or aggression against Iran. If anybody had a good reason to want a nuclear weapon, it was Iran. The third Axis member, North Korea, actually had one, and was not considered a realistic invasion target for that reason.     
  
Their fears of foreign invasion were real, and not abstract. Little more than 20 years before, Iran suffered hundreds of thousands killed, and over $600 billion in economic losses defending themselves from a US backed Iraqi invasion, which eventually involved offensive operations against Iran by the US navy, including the downing of an Iranian airliner, killing the 290 people aboard. During that conflict, 100,000 iranian soldiers, and an unknown number of civilians, were killed or wounded by iraqi chemical weapons. Iran did not deploy chemical weapons in the conflict. Any iranian over 30 is old enough to rember what total war is like. 
  
Now that the US has made a comprehensive deal with Iran, they no longer have any motivation to acquire a nuclear weapon. They are capable of defending themselves against local adversaries, and face no serious threats against which nuclear weapons would be necessary.

I'm totally fine with throwing Harriet Tubman on the twenty, by the way. Our currency could use some race and gender diversity. Why shouldn't we remove a president from currency, who would've hated to be there in the first place?

1516,CMV: There will never be another military draft (forced conscription) in America.,TRUE,1,t3_35gi8x,"Not really an opinion so much as a prediction, but its still a view i hold.  My prediction is based on a number of factors and you can address any or all of them or bring up new issues I haven't thought of.  

1) Unpopular: The draft for the war in Vietnam was extremely unpopular with massive protests and draft dodging.  After the draft was eliminated the protests died down even as the war continued.  It seems that America will support a lot of military activity (Iraq War 1 &amp; 2, Afghanistan, etc) as long as they are not personally forced to serve.  

2) No close border crisis: Other modern developed countries have forced selective service (South Korea, Israel) but usually these countries face bordering existential crises to their very existence.  America does not have this, has not ever had this, and presumably will not ever have this and so there is no need to have millions of men and women be conscripted every year for a tour of duty.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription

3) Nuclear Weapons: America may face small attacks here and there but no nation state large enough to possibly overthrow the United States government seems likely to attack for fear of nuclear weapons retaliation.  While 9/11 was a tragedy, there was no hope of terrorists taking over the country or overthrowing the government.  The only world forces strong enough to do this would be large nations with large militaries of their own and if they did have a mainland ground force invasion of US soil it would almost guarantee a nuclear response.

4) Women, and the out of shape:  This is a minor reason but none the less I'll bring it up for discussion.  In a modern draft there would be seemingly no way for women to avoid serving.  Currently women face demanding physical aptitude tests to qualify for the most demanding positions or in some cases are barred from service for fear they will not be able to handle the physical requirements of the job (front line combat, Navy Seals, etc).  In the 21st century when men and women have equal rights and are largely treated equally there would be pushback if those less capable of serving were thought to be more likely to get an easier or safer assignment.  This would create a race to the bottom for applicants seeking to avoid dangerous duty.  Furthermore the vast majority of Americans are overweight, out of shape, and would require extensive training to become combat ready.  If diabetes, heart conditions, obesity, or any number of conditions would disqualify a person from service I imagine people would quickly engage in unhealthy habits (or bribe doctors) in order to avoid service. 

5) Conscientious objectors: In previous generations there was a much stronger sense of duty, warrior culture, and sense of imminent danger which cultivated a value in service.  In the modern world, where people increasingly distrust their government, have more access to information, and are more likely to have diverse religious and philosophical views I do not see the public getting behind any major military involvement that would require a draft.  I would imagine there would be a rush to qualify yourself as a conscientious objector to the war in order to avoid combat even if that individual didn't feel that way immediately prior to the draft.

546,CMV: Ipads are overpriced and offer little to no value over comparable android/windows tablets.,TRUE,1,t3_3eknr4,"Not trying to start a flame war, I'm looking for a new tablet and I would consider an ipad, but I just don't see the appeal just yet.

1434,CMV: parents should not read their child's private journals/diaries.,FALSE,0,t3_366rsa,"
I do not believe parents have a right to read their children's diaries. If parents want to find out about their child's life, they can attempt to talk to them. Reading through their private diary will only create distance between the parent and child and lead to more communication issues. Trying to take a shortcut and bypassing verbal communication with your child is only indicative of a larger problem in the family dynamic and will never end well.
 I was discussing this topic in /r/adviceanimals (of all places) with a very well reasoned gentleman/lady but we could not come to an agreement on whether this behavior was acceptable. While I do understand the idea that frustration and worry for your child could lead someone to consider this action, I was simply unable to change my view, and was hoping for some further rational ideas here.

1195,CMV: Burritos are better than sandwiches,FALSE,0,t3_38ob5e,"Now, I understand that there are places where sandwiches are the better option, namely in the land of toasted bread, but overall I feel that most any sandwich can be made better by becoming a burrito/wrap.

Burritos are much more transportable, being easily held in the hand and having an aspect ratio more close to that of the human mouth, are much easier to eat without making a mess.

They are capable of holding a wider array of fillings, not being limited to things which will hold together under their own tensions, such as rice, beans, chopped lettuce, peppers and so on.

Tortillas are ""healthier"" than equivalent bread (as required for filling security). Of course this is entirely dependent on the types etc, taking a 1 to 1, assuming your ""average"" tortilla/wrap is equivalent to 2 slices of bread, it's fewer calories in the tortilla (in general).

So, why aren't burritos as good as sandwiches?

1389,CMV: .45 and .40 are vastly superior to the 9mm,TRUE,1,t3_36j1up,"In the shooting community there is a debate between 9mm and 40 or 45, generally between 9 and 45, though I also own .40 S&amp;W. I personally do not like the 9mm to the point that I refuse to purchase one unless it is in a subcompact. It is weak, anemic, doesn't penetrate well (less mass), imparts less energy and not satisfying to shoot. 

Why should anyone want to carry 9mm as a main defensive weapon (military too) when the .40 has so much more power, as a flat nose FMJ will impart more energy than a rounded 9mm, heavier weight yields better energy transfer, in hollow point form is larger than the 9 mm and for capacity; there is a difference of 1 round. 

The only valid argument I see is that the soft 9mm is easier to shoot so you are more accurate, but who is taking 25yrd shots? An optic like a micro red dot on your weapon would more than make up for any difference. ",1389,TRUE,,TRUE,1
659,CMV: Marriage is an unreasonable expectation of relationships.,TRUE,1,t3_3dj5zp,"New here, so please correct me if I am doing anything wrong.

Before I begin I want to point out that this is strictly opinionated and based off of personal observations. Also my grammar isn't the best so please forgive any errors.
 
The main issue I have with marriage is the consequences of ending it. I do understand that this can be avoided to a degree with prenuptial agreements however, they are generally frowned upon. The idea of penalizing someone for ending a failing relationship seems counterproductive to me. This creates a sense of security to those who have refrained from showing or disclosing certain habits or personality traits to their spouse. It also encourages many to ""let themselves go."" By that I mean things such as weight gain, poor hygiene, addictions, etc. 

Secondly, I have seen in many cases where there is just no repairing the relationship, yet the couple remains together due to the financial repercussions of ending their failed marriage. This ultimately leads to a very uncomfortable situation at home, especially for children. It also in many cases leads to infidelity which brings a plethora of problems itself.

All of that said, my opinion is probably a bit biased due to my now divorced parents' marriage, but I am open to hear other arguments on the issue.

Edit: First off, I'd like to thank everyone for their responses. I'd just like to clear up some things I didn't communicate well in my post.

1. By penalizing I wasn't just referring to spousal support and alimony but the legal fees as well.

2. The argument I made was not meant to necessarily knock the institution of marriage because I do think it can work but there does exist many problems with how a failed marriage is dealt with...at least here in the US. My issue is mainly with society's expectation that long term relationships must eventually lead to marriage when it is not for everyone.

Lastly, a few of you pointed out the issues that arise when one spouse stays at home with the children and the other wants out of the marriage down the line. I do now see more of a purpose for it when the intention is to start a family.

1080,CMV: To Secure Economic Interests is a Reasonable Cause for Military Action,TRUE,1,t3_39uocq,"I should start by saying that I believe all other options should be pursued to the fullest before putting the lives of anyone in danger. 

That being said, I believe that protecting, and even strengthening our economy and therefore our nation is a moral enough cause to put lives on the line. The role of government, especially in the modern world, is to protect not only the lives of its citizens, but to increase their quality of life. A stronger economy leads to better infrastructure, more social services, less crime caused by necessity.  (theoretically, though obviously not always true in practice)

Whether it be:

* Securing trade routes
* Security of natural resources
* Military action that stabilizes regions in which we do commerce
* Assisting allies who strengthen our economy with military aid

Real world examples of this could be:

* The money spent, and the lives endangered by patrolling coastal waters for pirates.

* The soldiers we sent to defend Kuwait from Iraq

* Soldiers on the DMZ of the Korean Peninsula


Keep in mind the assumption of this post is that the military action is a peace keeping, security purposed, deterrence force. Not a raiding party to steal the oil tile from the Mongols in CIV5.

For the entirety of existence, humans have felt that putting the lives of the few on the line for the prosperity of the many is not only morally acceptable, but commendable.

1225,CMV:It was entirely irresponsible of Rand Paul to filibuster in order to force the end of the Patriot Act,FALSE,0,t3_38aslm,"On Sunday, Rand Paul spoke  for 10 and a half hours in order to ensure that the Patriot Act, which contains sections used to justify government surveillance, would not be renewed.  While doing this, his campaign was selling [""Filibuster Starter Packs""](https://store.randpaul.com/index.php/filibuster-starter-pack.html) in order to garner support for his presidential bid.  He additionally used parts of his filibuster in a political video made for his campaign.  While I know my opinion that it is important to renew the patriot act is unpopular here on reddit, I think that it is fair that anyone who agrees with the act or not should consider the fact that Paul intentionally stalled debate on the matter, a matter of national security.  While Rand held the floor, shouting the same ideas over and over again in various permutations of the same couple lines about the government committing criminal acts and how American freedom is being violated, no informed debate on the matter could occur.  To prevent debate on a matter of national security like this I believe is already irresponsible, but to then to blatantly use this restriction of informed debate for the sake of promoting his own presidential bid makes it even more irresponsible.  I don't think that it is necessary for one to agree with the provisions of the patriot act (though I do) in order to believe that what Rand Paul did was incredibly irresponsible.

Now, I would anticipate that I will get some responses saying I likely find filibusters an irresponsible practice.  I still have mixed feelings about them on the whole, but I do want to focus on this specific one as I believe that it was entirely irresponsible.  

Finally, This is my first post on this sub, though I've been reading and commenting for some time.  So I just want to say this sub is an awesome community, so Thanks everyone!

154,CMV: Homo sapiens is in the end of its evolutionary path,FALSE,0,t3_3hma66,"Human being can not evolve further. 

Evolution requires environmental stress in order to select better adapted traits to spread to the population. Over time this spreading of traits drives evolution forward. 

At this point in time, most people (especially in the developed world, but not excluding the developing world) has access to limit or even remove environmental stress from their lives altogether. Some broad example: heating and cooling system, medicine, nutritious food. Better access to these allow individual with less adapted genes to survive and procreate. 

Furthermore, current social system hinders natural selection. In monogamous relationship, the chance of a person with better traits to procreate roughly similar to those with worse traits. Another example is that social security shares the risk through out the society: let's say a kid with diabetic can procreate and pass his/her gene to the gene pool because of access to treatment and medication (as opposed to in the wild, they most likely will not survive). I am not saying this is bad, but these characteristics dampen natural selection, thus evolution. 

Taking these into consideration and without any apocalyptic situations, I think human can not evolve further and we are basically evolutionary dead end. 

Please, correct my view. 

EDIT 1: people with obesity apparently have reduced chance of procreation (as per http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2970793/) which means their genes have a higher chance to be removed from the gene pool. This change may change Homo sapiens as a species. Evolution is still moving forward.

EDIT 2: the very things that remove the environmental stresses (temp control, nutrition, basically our current lifestyle) may eventually bring about the apocalyptic scenario on a massive scale, forcing Homo sapiens evolution.

1146,"CMV: If I ask for no guac, I should be able to get double sour cream for no cost.",FALSE,0,t3_399mw6,"As I am no fan of guacamole, every time I go to a Taqueria I ask for no guac, and on nachos for instance they will leave out the guac and put sour cream on half of my nachos.

My counterargument to that would be that by ordering a super burrito, nachos, whatever, you are stepping up to the guac and sour cream tier by default, but If I choose to forgo the guacamole and still pay the super nachos price, I am actually saving the Taqueria a small amount of money.

Ok, I am not advocating for everyone to go pull Lewinskies or anything, but what I'm saying is that they shouldn't be impeached or forced to resign, or face criticism on their ability to lead or shape policy. If they are a good policy maker fine. If they are making the world a better place and fighting for things that other politicians are afraid to then fine. As long as they don't be hypocrites on their policies, so what. Really the Clinton and Lewinsky scandal should have been handled between Bill and his wife, not the media and Congress. A city councilman just stepped down in my city for sexting someone 14 years his junior, however she was 34 and he's 48 neither one married, he's divorced a few years ago... how the hell does that call for a career to be ended? And now the speaker of the Missouri house of reps just resigned because he was sexting the capitol intern. If it was abuse or assault then ok, investigate, charge and punish them appropriately, but if its a matter of consensual legal sexual exchange, who are we to tell them no? I really wanna know why we shame politicians and ruin their careers because of things like sexting?

858,CMV: I don’t believe that heterosexuality is “default” or “normal”.,TRUE,1,t3_3bv0tp,"EDIT: Running off to lecture but I'll be back to check responses in a couple of hours. To copy and paste an abbreviated version my reasoning here: 

&gt;I think one of the larger roadblocks I'm running into in is distinguishing between identity, behavior, and biology. Because of how closely linked they are I was willing to concede non-heterosexuality encompassing orientations pretty much from the beginning. However I'm also stubbornly holding on to the idea that historically, heterosexual behaviors have been encouraged and any orientation that would facilitate them would be selected for. From there, I concluded that heterosexuality and bisexuality would be the two most likely sexualities to be propagated (by some abstracted gene selection process) but didn't understand why the more restrictive option would be selected for over the less restrictive one.

The answer seems to be hiding in probabilities so if anyone can expand on that more I'm willing to give deltas. 

Also, if you have a problem with my reasoning, please leave an explanation with your downvote so I can understand why it's off. 

---

I struggle to believe that most human beings are naturally supposed to only be attracted to the opposite sex and are inherently repulsed by same sex characteristics. I think most people identify as straight out of convenience and having never needed to question what was assumed for them. I’m not denying that heterosexuality is a legitimate orientation but I have not found convincing evidence against, for example, the possibility that most humans could be predisposed to bisexuality and simply develop a preference of one or none from there. 

The only arguments I’ve read for heterosexuality being default is the biological urge to have children, which I believe is neither universal nor exclusive to heterosexuality and the (imo fallacious) “most people are straight so there ***must*** be a biological mechanism that supports this phenomenon” path of reasoning. 

I'm willing to give a delta to any argument that can demonstrate why heterosexuality might be more advantageous  or likely than bisexuality.

1203,CMV: I do not believe that there are real paid pro-Kremlin propagandists on reddit.,FALSE,0,t3_38k4ia,"This is an accusation I've seen hurled around the likes of /r/worldnews- someone will post something which is even *slightly* pro-Russian and you can guarantee that there will follow an accusation of being a 'Putinbot' or 'a shill', or paid by the Kremlin. 
 
Now I do not believe that, whilst there may be those sympathetic to Russia posting on reddit (such as myself), there is any reason to believe that any of these sorts of posters are in any way connected to the Kremlin. 

If anything, reddit would be a pretty poor platform to do so, given that there are quite literally thousands of subreddits and even a concentrated effort by a large amount of these Kremlin propagandists would likely be diluted because of this, but also because of the down voting system. Most pro-Kremlin posts I've seen receive such massive amounts of down votes, they are buried. 

Plus it must also be said that even in default subreddits, such as /r/worldnews, Russian articles make up tiny amounts of total posts made, and so I cannot see the logic in any major organisation, and much less the Kremlin, throwing even moderate amounts of resources at tiny amounts of posts for propaganda purposes. 

I also believe cultural bias plays a part. It's a safe assumption a decently large amount of reddit users are either American or European. With this, this lends itself to cultural bias, and what I believe has happened is that given the nature of reddit, this blurs the lines to the point where few redditors distinguish between merely Russo-appreciative posts and plain silly, biased posts, and so every post which is positive about Russia is deemed to be the work of a Putinbot. 

  You also see this in news sources- the same redditors who immediately jump on posts referencing RT (Russia Today) or The Moscow Times are the same redditors who will show nothing of the same discernment for posts which reference sources such as the Daily Mail, HuffPo or other Western news sources which could be argued to be biased. 

So, CMV!

So far this is the logic I've heard again and again:
Self harm is bad because it is dangerous. It is dangerous because you could die, or could get an infection.

The problem I have seen with this is that you can replace ""self harm"" with so many other things and still follow the same basic structure.

Lacrosse is bad because it is dangerous. It is dangerous because you could get a concussion.

Cooking is bad because it is dangerous. You could get burned.

Taking Lithium for Bipolar Disorder is bad because it is dangerous.  It is dangerous because it could give you kidney failure.

So I can not accept the false-logic of dangerous = bad. That means anything dangerous is inherently bad, and that is not true.

It is very easy to self harm without any danger.  Sterilize tools, clean and cover wounds, etcetera.

Of course this can still leave permanent scars, but so can getting a tattoo or a piercing, so once again, self harm isn't inherently bad just because it leaves scars.  Lots of things leave scars, so scars aren't what's bad about it.

Okay, but it's a symptom of a bigger problem.  Yes.  And the bigger problem is the thing that should be fixed.  But that *still* doesn't mean that the symptom is bad.

If you have a bacterial infection, you treat the infection.  You don't just cover any redness up with makeup to treat the symptom.  So self harm, the symptom of many mood disorders, isn't what should be treated.

So besides the ridiculously flawed ""it's dangerous"" argument, explain to me why self harm is inherently bad.

Tl;Dr, something being dangerous doesn't make it bad. Give me a real reason why self harm is bad.

**EDIT**  I have to go to bed now, but I will continue this conversation with anyone who posts new comments in the morning.  Thank you to those of you who have offered support, and to those of you whose reasonings avoided condescension.

1087,CMV: I think having sex in elementary school would accelerate a boy's maturity. (So should I have had more sex in grade school?),FALSE,0,t3_39rfu4,"My gut feeling suggests that having sex while an elementary schoolboy would have made me mature faster - whether behaviorally or in other useful ways. I thought even as a grade schooler, I seemed too immature so I wish I had more sex in order to mentally / psychologically / emotionally grow up faster.

Wouldn't all the endorphins and other neurological pleasure chemicals cause my mind to progress faster than I would have otherwise? I'd like to think so...

But if you think early sex doesn't mature a boy, well why, and what'll it do to him instead? And despite all that, would it ""still be worth it?""

587,CMV: Romantic love is merely a platonic relationship combined with lust/physical attraction,TRUE,1,t3_3e811o,"Please leave the footnote below the following line, but remember to delete this sentence by replacing it with the body of your post. Thank you!

I believe the only difference between a romantic relationship and a friendship/platonic relationship is physical attraction.  Lots of people talk of love or some mystical force, but in reality people make all sorts of concessions with regard to a person's character flaws and personality, but no one I have met is willing to compromise in terms of a desire to get nekkid with the person of their dreams.  There are other factors that come into play with regard to the interaction lasting or being fulfilling, but I do believe that the only fundamental difference between these two types of interactions is the sexual element.  Change my view.

1249,CMV: I am a circumcised male. I see no issues with the procedure and would circumcise my child if he were born in the U.S. today.,TRUE,1,t3_381ey6,"First off, as a male who was circumcised at birth, I am glad that I was circumcised.  Any associated pain does not exist to me because I cannot remember it, in the exact same way that pain associated with other surgical procedures I have had under general anesthesia as an adult does not exist because I cannot remember it.

The WHO currently recommends male circumcision for HIV prevention and ""as part of a comprehensive HIV prevention package"".  It is primarily recommended in areas with high incidences of HIV, but given its demonstrated effect at reducing the spread of the virus I prefer to have any added protection possibly available.  I would plan to infer the same protection to any hypothetical children born at this time, especially considering that the complication rates here are significantly lower than in the areas where it is most strongly recommended by the WHO.

Living in the midwest U.S. it is culturally nearly expected, with 70-80% prevalence.  Because of this, many to most potential sexual partners in my area (including myself, as a gay male) prefer the aesthetic of a circumcised penis.  With the research consensus demonstrating no adverse effects on sexual performance, I see no reason to not stick with the cultural norm. 

What may help change my view:

* *Scientific studies* demonstrating prolonged psychological damage due to infant male circumcision.

* *Scientific studies* demonstrating that complication rates and severity in the U.S. outweigh potential benefits due to HIV resistance.

* *Scientific* evidence that circumcised males in the U.S. are demonstrably less satisfied with their sex lives than uncircumcised males.

What will *not* help change my view:

* ""People should be allowed to chose"".  Parents are wholly responsible for their children's health and well-being until they are capable of making those decisions on their own.  Circumcision complication rates increase dramatically with age.

* ""If everyone stopped doing it, it wouldn't be culturally expected anymore."" Yeah, not going to happen any time soon.  I am talking the choice for parents to circumcise in areas of the U.S. where it is highly prevalent today.

**TL;DR:  Not traumatized by own circumcision, culturally expected, +1 to HIV prevention. CMV.**",1249,FALSE,,TRUE,1
